But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn\u2019t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \n\u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of \u201can unrelated case\u201d\u2013which we now know to be Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn\u2019t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins\u2013at least two years\u2019 worth, and possibly an entire term\u2019s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him\u2013resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz\u2019 sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn\u2019t even know about Comey\u2019s letter at the time\u2013and only found out when they checked Twitter. \u201cDemocratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn\u2019t receive Comey\u2019s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn\u2019 receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.\u201d \nSo let\u2019s see if we\u2019ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn\u2019t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn\u2019t trample on basic standards of fairness, I don\u2019t know what does. \nGranted, it\u2019s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz\u2019 planned fishing expedition. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World.

Flynn", "text": "Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed \u201cno debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be\u201d (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). \u201cI am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us \u2014  the 400 of us,\u201d Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom \u2014  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for \u201cempathy\u201d for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented \u201cBlack Power demagogues\u201d and \u201celitist arrogance and repressive intolerance\u201d within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. \u201cTrust,\u201d Rodham ironically observed in 1969, \u201cthis is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said \u2018Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.\u2019 What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?\u201d The \u201ctrust bust\u201d certainly busted Clinton\u2019s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people \u2014  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November\u2019s election \u2014  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a \u201clie,\u201d a \u201ccon,\u201d \u201calternative facts,\u201d and \u201ca   assault on truth and reason. \u201d She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. \u201cAs the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\u201d she offered. \u201cThat is not hyperbole. \u201d Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that \u201cfor too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. \u201d Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\u201d she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn\u2019t president. The woman famously dubbed a \u201ccongenital liar\u201d by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in \u2014  theirs, mind you, not hers.

The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for \u201cregime change\u201d in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government\u2019s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out \u2013 specifically, how to tell when they are getting \u201ctrue\u201d intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need \u201c help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. \u201d To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \nA \u201cpartnership\u201d is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a \u201c permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board\u201d to coordinate programs in \u201csocial and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .\u201d \nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the \u201csocial and behavioral sciences\u201d cannot give the spy agencies what they want \u2013 a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \nThe Believers \nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth \u2013 that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \nTherefore, if someone feeds them \u201csnake oil,\u201d they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors \u2013 those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview \u2013 have different criterion for what is \u201ctrue\u201d than do the analysts. \nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council \u2013 yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, \u201c We\u2019re looking for truth. But we\u2019re particularly looking for truth that works. \u201d Now what might that mean? \nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, \u201ctruth\u201d must match up, fit with, their worldview \u2013 their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not \u201cwork.\u201d So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by \u201cgroup think,\u201d ideological blinkers, and a \u201cwe know better\u201d attitude. \nOn the other hand, as long as what you\u2019re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory \u2013 the list is almost endless. \nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers \u2013 the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class \u2013 presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare\u2019s determination that \u201cwhat is past, is prelude.\u201d Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will \u2013 no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power.

Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. \nThe Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month \u2013 the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. \nThe US claimed it had conducted a \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder\u2019s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. \nThe Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. \nRais\u2019 son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. \nRais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: \u201cI did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.\u201d \nThe deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. \nThe Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau\u2019s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. \nOn September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic \u2013 known as a \u201cdouble-tap\u201d strike \u2013 is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. \nThe US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. \nAt the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. \nIn both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. \nThe rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.

Rubin", "text": "PARIS  \u2014   France chose an idealistic, traditional   candidate in Sunday\u2019s primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring. The candidate, Beno\u00eet Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would \u201cmake France\u2019s heart beat,\u201d bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Valls\u2019s 41 percent. \u201cTonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future,\u201d Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. \u201cOur country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,\u201d he said. Mr. Hamon\u2019s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamon\u2019s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. France\u2019s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   M\u00e9lenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollande\u2019s government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamon\u2019s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollande\u2019s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Beno\u00eet Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. \u201cWe have a perspective we have something to do, to build,\u201d Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollande\u2019s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving France\u2019s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). \u201cWe have someone that trusts us,\u201d Mr. Kekenbosch said, \u201cwho says: \u2018I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonald\u2019s on provisional contracts for 4 years. \u201d Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "A Back-Channel Plan for Ukraine and Russia, Courtesy of Trump Associates - The New York Times", "author": "Megan Twohey and Scott Shane", "text": "A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny  \u2014   with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress  \u2014   some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to help bring about peace?\u201d Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence  \u2014   \u201cnames of companies, wire transfers\u201d  \u2014   showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. \u201cA lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent,\u201d Mr. Artemenko said. \u201cBut how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?\u201d Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko \u201cis not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration. \u201d At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against \u201cappeasement\u201d of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trump\u2019s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine\u2019s expense  \u2014   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko\u2019s. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trump\u2019s political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russia\u2019s hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossier\u2019s assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraine\u2019s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,\u201d he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. \u201cOur time has come!\u201d Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  \u2014   and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. \u201cIt is a gross violation of the Constitution,\u201d he said in written answers to questions from The Times. \u201cSuch ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests. \u201d The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenko\u2019s project also includes the dissemination of \u201ckompromat,\u201d or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenko\u2019s proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater \u201cwere sitting in the room right now,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t know what he looked like. \u201d But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. \u201cI want to stop a war, number one,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run. \u201d After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. \u201cFraud is never good, right?\u201d Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn\u2019s office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause.

[Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, \u201cInside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. \u201d  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible\u2019s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as \u201cadvocate[ing] for the president\u2019s policies. \u201d In a recent Facebook post titled, \u201cTake a deep breath. Then take action,\u201d OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. \u201cStay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide,\u201d the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner \u201cIndivisible,\u201d advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and \u201cgrab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together. \u201d Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican host\u2019s positions. \u201cThis will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus. \u201d It also urges them to ask \u201chostile\u201d questions  \u2014   while keeping \u201ca firm hold on the mic\u201d  \u2014   and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isn\u2019t \u201cgiving you real answers. \u201d \u201cExpress your concern [to the event\u2019s hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,\u201d it says.   \u2026    \u201cEven the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,\u201d the document states, \u201cbecause these actions create the impression that they\u2019re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents. \u201d Sperry reported OFA \u201cplans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare\u2019s repeal. \u201d Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFA\u2019s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  \u2014   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  \u2014   and a deputy campaign manager.   \u2026    OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisible\u2019s DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentine\u2019s Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that \u201cconservatives\u201d are \u201cspreading unfounded rumors\u201d that the group is \u201cbeing driven by wealthy donors like George Soros. \u201d Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outlet\u2019s own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible\u2019s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed \u201cIndivisible,\u201d the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have \u201csigned up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country. \u201d The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The group\u2019s website states: \u201cWhat\u2019s more, you all are putting the guide into action \u2014  showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. You\u2019re resisting \u2014  and it\u2019s working. \u201d Politico reported on \u201cunfounded\u201d rumors being spread about Soros\u2019s involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who we take money from  \u2014   we\u2019re always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we don\u2019t take money from Soros,\u201d said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the attacks and that\u2019s fine. \u201d While \u201cIndivisible\u201d has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politico\u2019s claim about \u201cunfounded rumors\u201d that Indivisibles\u2019 success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trump\u2019s immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padilla\u2019s group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center\u2019s International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisible\u2019s ties to the organizers of last month\u2019s   Women\u2019s March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 \u201cpartners\u201d of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders\u2019 own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Women\u2019s March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Women\u2019s March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.

Some believe that Nazi Germany, under the control of Adolf Hitler, possessed supernatural powers, and largely employed pseudo-science during the 1933-1945 period. However, some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact. Over the years, researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi Germany.\nNazi Germany invaded Russia (formerly the USSR) during the Second World War on June 22, 1941. At the time, the German army progressed deep into Russian territory, gaining ground close to the capital Moscow, before the Russians could counter-attack, eventually driving the Nazis back.\nDuring the Nazi occupation in Russia, in 1942, the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic, code-named \u201cSchatzgraber\u201d or \u201cTreasure Hunter,\u201d which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia. The base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of Nazi troops, warships and submarines. The base also housed eminent Nazi scientists, whom conducted many experiments to help progress a German win of the war. It was widely speculated at the time that the Nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings. The controversial Ahnenerbe was even linked to the base. The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany. Responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race, it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences. Founded on July 1, 1935, by Heinrich Himmler, Herman Wirth and Richard Walther Darr\u00e9, the Ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world.\nHowever, the Nazis abandoned the base in 1944 \u2013 a time when the Russian army began its offensive, pushing the Germans out of the country. According to a war-time story, supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels, and the Nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear, which ultimately, was infected with trichinosis. This caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a German U-boat. Despite Russian authors telling the story of \u201cTreasure Hunter,\u201d some observers consider it a myth, doubting its existence.\nBut Russian researchers have now announced that \u201cTreasure Hunter\u201d has been discovered, saying the base is on the island of Alexandra Land in the Arctic Circle, located 620 miles from the North Pole.\nA senior researcher at the Russian Arctic National Park, Evgeny Ermolov said in a statement announcing the discovery : \u201cBefore it was only known from written sources, but now we also have real proof.\u201d", "label": "1"}, {"title": "US Officials See No Link Between Trump and Russia", "author": "Jason Ditz", "text": "Clinton Campaign Demands FBI Affirm Trump's Russia Ties   \nWith the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaign\u2019s allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia.

For years, many have suspected that government trolls have been systematically causing havoc all over the Internet, but proving it has been difficult. But now thanks to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and revealed by Glenn Greenwald, we finally have hard evidence that western governments have been doing this. As you will see below, a UK intelligence outfit known as the Government Communications Headquarters, through a previously secret unit known as the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, has been systematically attempting \u201cto control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse\u201d. This should be deeply disturbing to anyone that values free speech on the Internet. \nIt isn\u2019t just that the British government is trying to influence what people are thinking. The reality is that this is far bigger than a mere propaganda campaign. As Greenwald recently noted on his new website , the \u201cintegrity of the Internet itself\u201d is at stake\u2026 \nBy publishing these stories one by one, our NBC reporting highlighted some of the key, discrete revelations: the monitoring of YouTube and Blogger , the targeting of Anonymous with the very same DDoS attacks they accuse \u201chacktivists\u201d of using, the use of \u201c honey traps \u201d (luring people into compromising situations using sex) and destructive viruses . But, here, I want to focus and elaborate on the overarching point revealed by all of these documents: namely, that these agencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse , and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself. \nSo what techniques are the British using to control and manipulate discourse on the Internet? According to Greenwald, the documents that Snowden has uncovered show that they are willing to sink to despicable lows in order to get the results that they desire\u2026 \nAmong the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: \u201c false flag operations \u201d (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting \u201c negative information \u201d on various forums. \nThe following is a list of Internet infiltration techniques that were listed on one particular slide that Snowden leaked\u2026 \n\u2013 Infiltration Operation \n\u2013 Sting Operation \nYou can check out this slide for yourself right here . \nThere is also evidence that the Canadian government has been involved in this sort of thing as well.   Natural News \u2026 \nYou\u2019ve probably run into them before \u2014 those seemingly random antagonizers who always end up diverting the conversation in an online chat room or article comment section away from the issue at hand, and towards a much different agenda. Hot-button issues like illegal immigration, the two-party political system, the \u201cwar on terror\u201d and even alternative medicine are among the most common targets of such attackers, known as internet \u201ctrolls\u201d or \u201cshills,\u201d who in many cases are nothing more than paid lackeys hired by the federal government and other international organizations to sway and ultimately control public opinion . \nSeveral years ago, Canada\u2019s CTV News aired a short segment about how its own government had been exposed for hiring secret agents to monitor social media and track online conversations, as well as the activities of certain dissenting individuals. This report, which in obvious whitewashing language referred to such activities as the government simply \u201c weighing in and correcting \u201d allegedly false information posted online, basically admitted that the Canadian government had assumed the role of secret online police . \nYou can see a video news report about this activity up in Canada right here . \nAre you disturbed yet? \nYou should be. \nSo what kind of people are the governments of the western world targeting online? \nWell, when it comes to the U.S. government, all you have to do is to look at their official documents to see who they consider the \u201cproblems\u201d to be. For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled \u201c 72 Types Of Americans That Are Considered \u2018Potential Terrorists\u2019 In Official Government Documents \u201c. \nSadly, the reality of the matter is that the days of the free and open Internet are numbered. The governments of the world are increasing their control over the Internet with each passing day, and eventually a time will likely come when we will not be able to communicate openly like this any longer. \nThings have gotten so bad in the U.S. already that even Google is spooked \u2026 \nA recent court decision that endorsed a broad view of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s authority over the Internet has Google and other Web companies nervous. \nIn closed-door meetings with regulators and Capitol Hill staff, Google\u2019s lawyers have said they\u2019re worried how the FCC may use its newfound powers, according to multiple people familiar with the meetings. \nThe extent of the FCC\u2019s authority over Google and other Web services remains unclear, and the current FCC has given no indication that it is interested in pushing aggressive new regulations. But the possibility that the commission could begin telling Google how to organize its search results or handle its users\u2019 data is enough to spook the company\u2019s army of Washington lobbyists. \nAnd this is just the beginning. \nIf you think that the control freaks that are running things now are bad, just wait until you see the next generation of control freaks. \nFor example, there is one prominent student writer at Harvard that apparently believes that free speech at her university should be abolished and that any professor that does not advocate for her politically-correct version of \u201cjustice\u201d should be fired \u2026 \nA student writer at Harvard University is raising eyebrows after publishing her belief that free speech on campus should be abolished and professors with opposing views be fired. \nSandra Korn, a senior who writes a column for the Harvard Crimson newspaper, thinks radical leftism is the only permissible political philosophy, and the First Amendment only hinders colleges from brainwashing students with her viewpoint. \n\u201cLet\u2019s give up on academic freedom in favor of justice,\u201d states the subtitle of her Feb. 18 column , in which she insists Harvard stop guaranteeing students and professors the right to hold controversial views and conduct research putting liberalism in a negative light. \n\u201cIf our university community opposes racism, sexism, and heterosexism, why should we put up with research that counters our goals?\u201d Korn asks. \nThis is what control freaks always want. \nThey always want to shut down those that are presenting opposing views. \nThey don\u2019t believe in free speech and a \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d. Rather, they believe in shoving what they believe down the rest of our throats. \nAnd now we have solid proof that the governments of the western world are paying people to manipulate discourse on social media, blogs, forums and websites. \nSo will there be great outrage over this, or will the apathetic public just roll over and ignore this like they have so many other times the past few years? \nMy guess, most will just roll over and ignore this. People don\u2019t care. Hammerstrike \nAt least I know why people disagree with me other dem intrenets now, they are paid trolls! Paid by the governement to spread falsehoods and hurt muh feelins! seth datta \nMost of my comments get deleted by bankster paid control freaks if they don\u2019t troll my comments. Banksters truly are the psychopaths destroying the world. K \nThe amazing thing is, they are not that hard to spot. But since like so many other things, people will not face the truth. This information will only help a very few. For those of you still sitting on the fence. How much more evidence do you need? How many more ways does the Government have to mess with you? What will it finally take, to say enough? Rodster \n\u201cDon\u2019t confuse me with the facts. I already made up my mind.\u201d SupernaturalCat \n\u201cThe amazing thing is, they are not that hard to spot. But since like so many other things, people will not face the truth.\u201d \nIndeed. Never underestimate the power of denial. DJohn1 \nThis is called doing anything for a paycheck. Otherwise known in the world as prostituting for money. Snowden probably has a few other \u201csurprises\u201d in the material he has not released yet. This also dates back to way before the internet was ever thought of. PR firms for the government have been making fun of anything that they truly want to hide. Such as any legitimate UFO reporting over the last 50 or so years. Anyone with a thorough knowledge of Solar System Astronomy was made to feel like a nut as far back as the 50s. One Russian Scientist came up with a fantastic theory of how Venus came to be where it is in the Solar System. In 1949 or 1950 scientists all over the planet wanted his books banned from publication and actually boycotted anyone that would pub his work. His theory said that Venus was extremely hot(800 degrees Fahrenheit). That the planet had a weird rotation. That it possibly came into the Solar System around the time of Joseph of Egypt and 400 years later caused the plagues of Egypt under Moses. That placed it in BIblical times. Well Venus does have a weird day. It is longer than its year. Venus is full of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. It has an atmosphere much thicker than the Earth\u2019s. All of which sort of lend credit to the theory. It is volcanic and has a very hot surface. In 1950, astronomers were guessing that Venus was a twin to Earth with a slightly higher temperature. Possibly 150 at the equator and comfortable at the poles. Then the Russian Drones sent to Venus told an entirely different story and blew all of the astronomers out of the water. I hope I am embarrassing them for their efforts to ban the man from publication. He spent his years at Princeton University after leaving Russia. Two aspects of the theory should make us all sit up and listen. He claimed the Hydrocarbons rained oil over the surface of the Earth and that might be where a lot of Earth\u2019s supply of oil came from. The Russians are acting on that theory to find new oil reserves. The second aspect is that Venus played a kind of bounce game as it came down through the Solar System and removed the second planet from the Sun in the process and dumped it out further in the Solar System. He thought that Mars was originally in the orbit where Venus is today. His theory was that mankind forgot what happened in a kind of national amnesia. IF what he says was true, then Mars could have had a thick enough atmosphere and water to support life! More important it might have had a thick magnetic layer that filtered out the Sun and kept the planet temperate at one time. All of which was ruined as Venus dragged it out of orbit. That might have happened in biblical times. The Earth might have been slightly closer to the Sun with a 360 day year instead of 365 and a quarter day year. This of course is all speculation until we go out there and find out the real truth of what is going on. My own guess is that if there is life on Mars it is in caves under the surface with a slightly heavier atmosphere and possibly seas in these huge caverns. If there is any surface life left, it is likely to be about the size of a dog or a racoon. If there is large life, I suspect it will be Sand Worms deep in the sands of Mars. I mention this because it is very easy to ridicule ideas. The one I just told you about actually happened in the 50s and was ridiculed coast to coast by actual scientists. We are in a universe with over 100 billion galaxies out there. The number of stars with life possible is at a fantastic number. If one in a million stars has life, that is still a whole lot of life out there. The only explanation that makes sense to me is we are far off the trade lanes between the stars. Otherwise we would have been contacted years ago. Or have we been? I suggest that when a civilization reaches the level of using Atomic Bombs then that civilization bares watching. We had a lot of UFO activity after World War II and the setting off of bombs all over the planet as governments tested these weapons. Governments all over the world that are big enough are probably hiding a lot of things from all of us. I think we might all be amazed at just exactly what has been withheld. NowAlive \nThis is quite a postulation on the mere evidence that was correct, namely the temperature of Venus. The plagues of Egypt were localized. You had firstborns killed unless you used a passover lamb. Second, what about the oils raining down all over the Earth? I was quite young when Valdez crashed. The oil rig explosion in the Gulf is more recent. The hydrocarbon dumping would have killed off most life on the planet. Basically my point is that observational science shows that virtually none of what you just stated has been proven or even has any legitimate evidence. It\u2019s wild speculation. I\u2019m not an astrophysicist, but I doubt you are either. The governments hiding things is obvious. This in no way shows life on Mars or Venus dumping oil or switching orbital positions. It does not even slightly point to alien visitations or life. I\u2019m not trying to offend you. I\u2019m just trying to understand what you just said in a way that shows there is some evidence for it. DJohn1 \nYou are quite right. It is wild speculation on my part. Except the temperature is not the only evidence. Venus rotates the wrong direction in its spin or day. It is the only planet in the entire solar system to do so. The day is 268 of our days long. The year is 222 of our days. That the temperatures are so high could just be the closeness to the Sun. The atmosphere is 15 times thicker than our planet\u2019s atmosphere. That speaks to me that something unusual is going on. As for the oil, it is showing up in places that only a rain of oil might explain. The critical thing that we do not know is When it occurred or if it occurred at all. If I am right, there is a good possibility that the Moon will have some fairly large deposits of oil under the surface. There is a lot of unexplained discoloration on face of the Moon. If there is oil under the surface of the Moon, it might also mean that the Moon was a small planet at one time with an atmosphere and life. Again, I am speculating. The theory did not come from astrophysics. It came from examining a lot of stories all over the planet from the approximate time of Moses. That was Velinkovsky\u2019s specialty, ancient languages and psychology of ancient cultures. Rastus \nA field of study that you may or may not have heard of is called \u201ccatastrophism\u201d. Not without its critics and highly controversial among biblical scholars, you may find the subject a good scratch to your itch. A book by Donald Wesley Patten called \u201cCatastrophism And The Old Testament\u201d might be in accordance with your fancy. Johnny \nAre you speaking of Immanuel Velikovsky? He is the Author of Worlds in Collision. He points out the chaos of the universe. I found him interesting to read in 1958. DJohn1 \nYes. He was not a specialist in astronomy. He simply pointed out what the beliefs of the ancient world were. He did upset the scientific world of his time. I think he was at least 50% right about things. We now know that Venus could not have come from Jupiter or Saturn. My own thought is that it had to come from the outer solar system or beyond. We have well over 100 moons around the planets. Most of which are around the gas giants. Most of which have a nickel/iron core. None of which could have come from the major gas giants in the Solar System. They had to come from something much more dense and much older. The man most likely to shake the core beliefs of astrophysics and astronomy is an accomplished astronomer, Dr. Mike Brown. What he is finding is there are a series of small, Pluto sized planets, some with small moons in the outer solar system. Scientists have been looking in the wrong place. Of the four new planets he has found, they seem to be 40-50 degrees off the orbits of the gas giants. Some are in extremely comet like orbits and at least one is on its way out of the Solar System. I am no scientist. A lot of what I read about it makes little sense with current theories. Unless there is something out there that is big enough to drag small planets and moons out of their original orbits around the Sun. Some think we have a brown dwarf about a light year out at the edge of the Sun\u2019s influence(gravity). So far no one has found it. I think we are looking in the wrong places. IF there is a brown dwarf, it is quite small as stars go. IF it is in a comet-like orbit, then somewhere down the road it will return causing all kinds of changes in the Solar System. IF it has planets around it, then those planets might cause a lot of destruction as they come close to existing planets and moons in our solar system. Our planets as viewed from the North and top of the Solar System rotate around the Sun counter-clockwise. IF this brown dwarf is rotating clockwise around the Sun, that might complicate finding and plotting an orbit for it. IF it is way off the angle that most planets orbit the Sun, that might also keep it from being discovered. I do find it interesting that a lot of astronomy telescopes are moving towards the South Pole for observations. Known Brown Dwarf Stars do exist around stars in our stellar neighborhood and some are independent of any other stars all within about 12 light years of our Sun. A lot of what we do know is kept fairly low key and doesn\u2019t really get a lot of news headlines. How many people know about Dr. Brown\u2019s work in the outer solar system? How many know about the gap(hole) in the orbits of the ORB cloud? A gap big enough for something the size of Venus or much larger could have made in the outer asteroid belt. I think it is possible that an object possibly the size of a gas giant might be out there somewhere but so little light is coming from it that we will only discover it by accident. What is significant is we are still learning about new planets in our own solar system. The governments have spent enormous amounts of money in this area through NASA. So someone must think we have things out there we need to know. GrimReaperLady \nI found your reply facinating! There is no way we are the only planet with life. I think I am going to go read some scientific journals, any suggestions. jaxon64 \nAwesome distraction technique\u2026you turned a discussion of govt media control and trolling into a lengthy discussion of planetary formation?\u2026truly masterful. You deserve a raise. DJohn1 \nThank you. Just for the record, I have no salary from the U.S. Government for trolling. The only funds from them I see is my monthly Social Security Check as someone that has retired. Not sure how long that lasts before they steal what they haven\u2019t all ready spent out of the general fund. The true masters are the PR people hired to keep the sheep all sleeping peacefully while the government steals everything in sight. I started getting suspicious about 20 years ago, when the entire newspaper business stopped mud raking and went with bland stories handed out by the wire services. It appears stirring up things has legal penalties and newspapers do not want to get hung up in legal battles. So they run news from wire services and leave the real reporting to others. Making advertisers angry has financial penalties as well, so lord help the reporter that angers an advertiser. Everything is wrapped up in money motivations. That above anything else is what has destroyed the country\u2019s estate that used to bring down the crooked politicians. The only way this related to planetary formation is that this media was used to go against this man by scientists that were angry at his claims. These scientists literally boycotted the publishers willing to pub his work. My own thought is that controling the scientific discovery press is just as bad. Jonathon von Tischner \nA good video on that is \u201cReturn of the Nephilim\u201d by Chuck Missler. DJohn1 \nImmanuel Velikovsky wrote the book in question. Worlds in Collision was the title. He was wrong about a lot of things. For instance I do not think it is possible to have Venus come out of Jupiter. The elements are different. Venus has a heavy core vs Jupiter has a Hydrogen and Helium core. What he did get right was a lot of facts about what Venus actually consisted of. My own idea is Venus might have been a wondering planet not orbiting any Star. I mentioned this man because by coincidence he did get a lot of things right. His ideas should not have been debunked or censored in any way. How was Venus created? I think it might have come from Brown Dwarf that was coming apart at the seams. That would make it a whole lot older than Velinkovsky thought. The idea is Brown Dwarfs might have a lot of heavy materials on them than regular stars and gas planets. We have an entire solar system full of heavy objects like that. We also have at least 4 gas giants that consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. The question is where did all of those heavy material objects consisting of nickel/iron cores come from? That is a question that most astronomy scientists do not have a good answer yet. 2\u00a2Wurth \nWow, less than two sentences into the article and the icon of Gary2 started appearing on the left and right sides of the screen.

Its not like this garbage works and they are so easy to spot. For instance, on YT, they are always a dead give away, as for 95% of the time, they use a First and Last name, which from what i can tell, is autogenerated through some script they use. I had seen in a video, the FedBizOpps site putting out a contract for a system to make multiple IDs for use in some Social Media program. If i recall, it was the Air Force or something like that. Operation Earnest Voice was another one as well. But they basically log in through some front-end of sorts, and they dont actually use YT like we do. The profiles are ALWAYS empty: no dates, no vids, no likes, no uploads, no playlists, nothing on the \u2018About\u2019 section. Its all pure vapor. \nAnd Cass Sunstein was the one who recommended all this in his paper, calling it \u2018cognitive infiltration\u2019, and who is another Dr Goebbels wanna-be and who should be hung from a tree.

Troll or no troll, if i dont like what youre saying to me, i have 3 words for you \u2018Go F yourself.\u2019 This is what actually enrages me more than anything, that they feel everyone but themselves, are going to be that malleable, zombified and sloth-like, to just believe everything they spew. If its one thing i hate, its people with superiority complexes, they are just a total scourge on the planet and its mindset of every control-freak authoritarian out there, past, present and future. Randall Thrift \nThe illusion of privacy is just that, AN ILLUSION.

Statistically speaking, he was the 28th when he made his debut for the Columbus Crew in 2007. But Schelotto\u2019s phone still rings to this day, more than six years after he left the league, with calls from fellow Argentines looking for advice. Though Schelotto, 43, is currently the coach of Boca Juniors, the most decorated team in Argentina, most of the players who call him want to talk about other teams, about other countries, about a soccer world away from the   environment of Buenos Aires. \u201cMost of them like to talk about the cities,\u201d Schelotto said. Many of them find a way to come. Argentines now make up the   demographic in M. L. S. trailing only Americans. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, going into this season\u2019s openers, 98 Argentine players had been featured in an M. L. S.   game since the league\u2019s inception. Sebastian Blanco, a new designated player for Portland, made his debut in an opener Friday and became No. 99. In a ranking by nationality, Argentines have the   goal total, too. Twelve of the 22 teams in M. L.

Others come for the lifestyle, the chance to fade into a comparative anonymity unavailable to them at home, or to live the \u201cquiet, clean\u201d life that Schelotto describes as he reminisces about his days in Ohio. The Portland Timbers playmaker Diego Valeri was one such player who called Schelotto, his former manager, and he eventually heeded his advice. But he said it was for an entirely different reason. A year before he signed with Portland, while under contract to his hometown club Lanus, Valeri had had a gun pressed to his throat when robbers attempted to steal his BMW with his wife, Florencia, and daughter, Connie, inside. \u201cAfter that moment,\u201d Valeri said with considerable understatement, \u201cwe thought about opportunities to play outside and know different places in the world. \u201d Within a year, Valeri, who had had loan spells in Portugal and Spain, was on his way to Portland. \u201cSituations like that are very hard for the Argentinian people to change,\u201d he said. The    Valeri and his family are now settled in the Northwest, where he is playing arguably the best soccer of his career. He is a     and in between was named the most valuable player when Portland won the 2015 M. L. S. Cup championship game. \u201cI think they like the anonymity and the tranquillity here,\u201d Caleb Porter, Valeri\u2019s coach with the Timbers, said of his star and his countrymen. \u201cThey really relish the opportunity to be here and to live a lifestyle that\u2019s different to how they lived in Argentina. They transition well into M. L. S. \u201d Since 2011, Portland has signed six Argentines, including its   acquisition of Blanco, 28. Valeri has been a good ambassador  \u2014   he speaks English and urges newcomers to try to learn it as soon as possible, to ease the transition. But Porter and the Timbers\u2019 general manager and president of soccer, Gavin Wilkinson, believe there is another, more straightforward reason for Argentina\u2019s outsize presence in M. L. S.: It simply produces the kind of technical player that the league desires. \u201cCertain countries produce certain positions more,\u201d Porter said. \u201cMost teams are looking for that creative piece, and you know you can get one in Argentina. \u201d A large alumni directory and strong ties to agents and consultants in the region have made that kind of shopping easier for M. L. S. teams, and in the past the struggles of the Argentine economy also favored North American clubs, some said. But there also has been a change in the kind of individual looking to make the move north, and that has dovetailed with the league\u2019s overall transfer policy. As the quality of M. L. S. has improved as it enters its third decade, its teams have looked less for marketability from its imports  \u2014   which in the past had trended toward aging, often European stars  \u2014   and more toward onfield impact and value. The latest class of Argentines reflects this shift, as they enter a league where the average age of designated players  \u2014   the team\u2019s   stars  \u2014   has fallen below 28, its lowest point in a decade. \u201cThey know that M. L. S. is different to 10 years ago,\u201d said Schelotto, who was 34 when he moved to the league. \u201cThey can go, make good money, play with some pressure. They know they can make a career in the United States and then maybe move to Europe. \u201cTen years ago, it was impossible. Right now, you can. \u201d There are currently 24 Argentines playing in the league. Atlanta United and its Argentine coach, Tata Martino, brought in three ahead of its first season, each of them 25 or younger (Villalba is just 22). Buying young is now seen as more of a benefit to clubs than a risk, as players who continue to develop retain a   value if they move on to brighter prospects in Europe. \u201cPeople are coming here younger and younger, maybe to start their careers,\u201d Ignacio Piatti, a    playmaker for the Montreal Impact, said through an interpreter. \u201cIt\u2019s what they are looking for at that age: being able to live a comfortable life off the field and focus on their games. \u201d Piatti, like Schelotto, has been happy to offer advice to the next wave of Argentine talents considering entering M. L. S. including players on both sides of the Hudson River. Gonzalo Veron, 27, of the Red Bulls, and Moralez, 30, who recently signed with New York City F. C. both acknowledged that they had turned to Piatti for advice before signing. At a community event in East Harlem last week, Moralez  \u2014   who spent four years in Italy  \u2014   reflected on his decision to move to the United States. He had never been to New York City before signing, he said, and after turning to the likes of Piatti and David Villa for advice about the league\u2019s standard of play, he said he also sought assurances for his family, who are set to join him in New York shortly. \u201cFirst off, I just want to enjoy football,\u201d Moralez said. \u201cBut also to get to know the beauty of the city and the country. Not everybody gets the opportunity to come here. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Wells Fargo Chief Abruptly Steps Down - The New York Times", "author": "Michael Corkery and Stacy Cowley", "text": "The scandal engulfing Wells Fargo toppled its chairman and chief executive on Wednesday, as John G. Stumpf announced his departure from the company, effective immediately. The move was a swift and stunning fall for an executive whose bank made it through the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed, only to be undone by a   sales scandal that pervaded its community banking division and percolated under the surface for years. It was an extraordinary moment even in the banking industry, which has been bedeviled by criticism and regular scandals since the financial crisis. Despite the industry\u2019s many troubles, relatively few banking chiefs have stepped down under outside pressure. But Wells Fargo\u2019s transgressions were unusually blatant and straightforward, which contributed to the   public outcry. This time, there were no exotic financial instruments, complicated trades or complex mortgage trickery. The bank\u2019s misdeeds were fundamentally simple: Under intense pressure to meet aggressive sales goals, employees created sham accounts using the names  \u2014   and sometimes, the actual money  \u2014   of the bank\u2019s real customers. And in some cases the customers did not discover the activity until they started accumulating fees. The reaction to the fake accounts at Wells Fargo, and to Mr. Stumpf\u2019s response to what has been uncovered as a widespread problem, has been withering and unrelenting. Wells Fargo has been under fire from irate customers, regulators, lawmakers and former employees since last month, when it disclosed that it would pay $185 million in fines and penalties over the unauthorized creation of as many as two million bank and credit card accounts over a period of at least five years by branch employees who were said to be under intense pressure to hit ambitious product sales goals. The sales practices may reach back far longer. Former bank employees told The New York Times of concerns they raised internally as far back as 11 years ago. Mr. Stumpf, 63, who was twice called in front of Congress to testify about the scandal in recent weeks, faced vocal demands to resign from an outraged public, but the timing of his departure was unexpected given that the Wells Fargo board had not completed its internal investigation into the phony accounts and that the bank reports   earnings on Friday. He potentially walks away with millions of dollars, including a $20 million pension, as of Wednesday, another $4. 3 million in deferred compensation, plus stock worth $109 million, according to data from Equilar. As the scandal erupted, Mr. Stumpf, who grew up on a dairy and poultry farm in Minnesota and had long emphasized his folksy roots, was unable to quell the uproar. Rather, he often seemed to inflame it. During his testimony in front of Congress, Mr. Stumpf said he took responsibility for the problems, but would not admit that there anything wrong with the bank\u2019s broader culture. When pressed repeatedly by members of the Senate Banking Committee about why he had not given back any of his lavish compensation, Mr. Stumpf insisted that the decision was not up to him, but to the bank\u2019s board. He was reminded that he was the board\u2019s chairman. One senator on the banking committee noted that criticism of the Wells Fargo scandal was one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans had agreed on in a long time. Mr. Stumpf\u2019s spent 34 years at a bank that had once been regarded as a darling on Wall Street because of its ability to churn out profits even as other banks struggled. Mr. Stumpf was named chief executive in 2007 and was one of the country\u2019s   bankers, earning about $19 million last year. He was named the 2013 Banker of the Year by the trade publication American Banker. Wells Fargo was once the most valuable bank as measured by the price of its stock, which attracted the billionaire Warren E. Buffett as its largest shareholder. Mr. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, has a stake of about 10 percent. Mr. Buffett did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Wells Fargo has since ceded the most valuable bank distinction to JPMorgan Chase. The board received a letter from Mr. Stumpf early on Wednesday indicating that he intended to retire, according to a person briefed on the matter. This person said the board was still in the early stages of conducting its investigation into the fake accounts and Mr. Stumpf\u2019s handling of the scandal and had not drawn any conclusions from its inquiry. The board was not scheduled to meet on Wednesday when it received Mr. Stumpf\u2019s letter, which this person described as brief and lacking any indication as to why the longtime C. E. O. decided to leave now. Top bank executives were expecting that Mr. Stumpf would address analysts and investors  \u2014   as he has always done  \u2014   when Wells Fargo reports its   results on Friday. Wells Fargo said Mr. Stumpf would be replaced by Timothy J. Sloan, its president and chief operating officer. Just two days earlier, the San Francisco bank shuffled its top management to give more responsibility to Mr. Sloan. \u201cI am grateful for the opportunity to have led Wells Fargo,\u201d Mr. Stumpf said in a written statement. \u201cWhile I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside. \u201d Mr. Sloan was informed early Wednesday that he was the bank\u2019s new C. E. O. though he had known for several days that Mr. Stumpf was preparing to step down. In an interview, Mr. Sloan said Mr. Stumpf had told him of his decision to retire after concluding that he would most likely continue to be the focus of much of the criticism being leveled at the bank. \u201cIt was an incredibly selfless decision,\u201d Mr. Sloan said. Federal regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney began looking into the issue in 2013. The deal Wells Fargo announced last month to settle cases brought by their offices was intended to resolve the matter, but it instead opened the floodgates, provoking a furious outpouring of questions, criticism and new information about what former employees say was a   culture of toxic sales pressure. The Department of Justice and Labor Department opened their own inquiries. Mr. Sloan said the bank had already named a new head of community banking, ended the retail banking sales goals that employees blamed for putting them under undue pressure and extended its review of its sales practices back to 2009. Originally, the bank\u2019s review covered its activities only between 2011 and 2015. Mr. Sloan will not hold the dual of roles of chief executive and chairman as Mr. Stump had. Mr. Stumpf agreed last month to surrender stock grants valued at $41 million  \u2014   another highly unusual move on Wall Street, where clawback provisions have been widely adopted but are almost never deployed. Mr. Stumpf said he would give up his $2. 8 million annual salary for the duration of the board\u2019s investigation. Because his departure is a resignation, Mr. Stumpf will leave without any severance, according to Oscar Suris, a company spokesman. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who blasted Mr. Stumpf when he appeared before the Senate last month, fired off a scathing statement on Wednesday. \u201cAs I said at the hearing last month, Mr. Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made while this scam was going on, and face an investigation by the Justice Department and S. E. C. ,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far, he\u2019s one for three. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Anonymous Donor Pays $2.5 Million To Release Everyone Arrested At The Dakota Access Pipeline", "author": "Starkman", "text": "A Caddo Nation tribal leader has just been freed after spending two days behind bars in North Dakota.

McNeil Jr. and Pam Belluck", "text": "Orders for abortion pills by women in seven Latin American countries with Zika outbreaks increased after health officials in those countries warned that the virus might cause severe birth defects, according to a women\u2019s organization supplying such pills. Orders from women in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela roughly doubled, while those from Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras went up by from 36 percent to 76 percent, researchers said in a study published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. The authors of the study included a leader of the group based in Amsterdam that is supplying the pills, Women on Web, a nonprofit staffed by doctors helping women from countries where abortion is illegal or restricted to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Even with the increase in demand for abortion pills, the number of orders received by Women on Web from Latin America and the Caribbean in that time period was small: slightly more than 2, 300 in the region, with about 1, 600 of those in countries where health authorities had warned about Zika\u2019s potential to cause brain damage. In the countries where Zika warnings were issued, there are typically about 3. 5 million abortions per year, said Gilda Sedgh, the principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization which was not involved in the study. So, Dr. Sedgh said, \u201cThe increase in demand for abortion observed by the authors in countries affected by Zika could be spurious because Women on Web accounts for a small share of all abortions in that part of the world. \u201d The numbers could be \u201can early warning sign\u201d of increased demand for abortion because of Zika, Dr. Sedgh said, adding that it is also possible that Women on Web \u201cmight have experienced an increase in demand as a result of increased visibility of their services when health advisories were issued. \u201d Access to abortion has been a contentious issue for years in many of the countries affected by Zika, but Zika has brought fresh attention to the debate. In Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a recent study, there are about 6. 5 million abortions each year. Most of them are illegal, and an estimated 750, 000 women a year are treated for complications from unsafe abortions in the region, Dr. Sedgh said. Women\u2019s rights groups have long pressed for abortion restrictions to be eased. The study looked at orders for pills between Nov. 17, 2015, when the Pan American Health Organization issued an alert saying Zika virus might be linked to a surge in infants born with tiny heads and damaged brains in Brazil, and March 2 of this year. It compared actual orders to the number that would have been expected based on orders during the previous five years. Women on Web has a history of defying legal restrictions in such countries, which sometimes block access to its website or seize the packages it sends. The nonprofit also asks women unable to pay for their prescription to write an email explaining why they needed the abortion pill and could not afford it. \u201cSome of the emails that came in were heartbreaking,\u201d said Dr. Abigail R. A. Aiken, a reproductive health researcher at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, and the lead author of the study. \u201cThe fear and desperation was really hard to read. \u201d A woman from Venezuela wrote, \u201cI contracted Zika 4 days ago,\u201d adding: \u201cI love children. But I don\u2019t believe it is a wise decision to keep a baby who will suffer. I need an abortion. I don\u2019t know who to turn to. Please help me ASAP!\u201d An email from a woman in Colombia said, \u201cHere Zika is a major problem and the health authorities do not help with it. \u201d She added: \u201cI have no resources at this time and want to ask for your help because fear overwhelms me. What if the baby is born sick? !\u201d Even more than it has increased attention on restrictive abortion laws, the Zika crisis has highlighted the issues of access to contraception and ways that women are   about birth control or discouraged from using it in some of the countries. In the face of Zika, some countries have been working to increase the availability and use of contraception. Women on Web is an offshoot of Women on Waves, which was founded in 1999 by Dr. Rebecca Gomperts. Women on Waves originally sailed a Dutch boat to countries that outlawed abortion, took women on board and performed abortions outside a nation\u2019s territorial waters. As internet access in poor countries increased, Dr. Gomperts began supplying mifepristone and misoprostol pills, a combination approved by the World Health Organization for abortion in the first 10 weeks of a pregnancy.

The vote is a huge step forward in the campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons launched several years ago by nonnuclear weapons states and civil society from across the globe. \nDismayed by the failure of the nuclear weapons states to honor their obligation under Article VI of the Non Proliferation Treaty which requires them to pursue good faith negotiations for the elimination of their nuclear arsenals, and moved by the growing danger of nuclear war, more than 120 nations gathered in Oslo in March of 2013 to review the latest scientific data about the catastrophic consequences that will result from the use of nuclear weapons. The conference shifted the focus of international discussion about nuclear war from abstract consideration of nuclear strategy to an evaluation of the medical data about what will actually happen if these weapons are used. It was boycotted by all of the major nuclear powers, the US, Russia, UK, China and France, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, or P5. \nFurther meetings in Nayarit, Mexico and Vienna followed in 2014 and culminated in a pledge by the Austrian government to \u201cclose the gap\u201d in international law that does not yet specifically outlaw the possession of these weapons. More than 140 countries ultimately associated themselves with the pledge which was fiercely opposed by the United States and the other nuclear weapons states, and in the fall of 2015 the UN General Assembly voted to establish an Open Ended Working Group which met in Geneva earlier this year and recommended the negotiations approved Thursday. \nThe United States, which led the opposition had hoped to limit the \u201cYes\u201d vote to less than one hundred, but failed badly. The final vote was 123 For, 38 Against and 16 Abstentions. The \u201cNo\u201d votes came from the nuclear weapons states, and US allies in NATO, plus Japan, South Korea and Australia which have treaty ties to the US and consider themselves to be under the protection of the \u201cUS nuclear umbrella\u201d. \nBut four nuclear weapons states broke ranks, with China, India and Pakistan abstaining, and North Korea voting in favor of the treaty negotiations. In addition, the Netherlands defied intense pressure from the rest of NATO and abstained, as did Finland, which is not a member of NATO but has close ties with the alliance. \nJapan which voted with the US against the treaty has indicated that it will, nonetheless, participate in the negotiations when they begin in March. \nThe US and the other nuclear weapons states will probably try to block final approval of the treaty conference by the General Assembly later this fall, but, following Thursday\u2019s vote, it appears overwhelmingly likely that negotiations will begin in March, and that they will involve a significant majority of UN member states, even if the nuclear states continue their boycott. \nThe successful completion of a new treaty will not of itself eliminate nuclear weapons. But it will put powerful new pressure on the nuclear weapons states who clearly do not want to uphold their obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty even as they insist that the nonnuclear weapons states meet theirs. \nWe have come perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions during the last 70 years, and we have been incredibly lucky. US nuclear policy cannot continue to be the hope that we will remain lucky in the future. We need to join and lead the growing movement to abolish nuclear weapons and work to bring the other nuclear weapons states into a binding agreement that sets out the detailed time line for eliminating these weapons and the detailed verification and enforcement mechanisms to make sure they are eliminated. \nThis will not be an easy task, but we really have no choice. If we don\u2019t get rid of these weapons, someday, perhaps sooner rather than later, they will be used and they will destroy human civilization. The decision is ours. \nIra Helfand , MD, is past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility and is currently co-president of that group\u2019s global federation, the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, recipient of the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize.

However, things didn\u2019t go so well for Hillary Clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign \u2014 which backfired big time. \nWhile Donald Trump\u2019s 15,000-person army of \u201cDeplorables\u201d were holding down the fort in Stanford, Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again, Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College. Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than she\u2019s used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state. However, Hillary\u2019s anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. \nPerhaps Hillary didn\u2019t think anyone would notice, but Fox Business Network was watching \u2014 and commenting \u2014 live. With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. As the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. \n\u201cHere it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000. There\u2019s maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today,\u201d one host pointed out much to Hillary\u2019s embarrassment. \u201cThe Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there\u2019s empty space here and she\u2019s supposed to speak in 15 minutes. And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed,\u201d the commentators added. \nNo matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. \nOn the other hand, there are Trump\u2019s rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillary\u2019s that these massive stadiums can\u2019t contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of what\u2019s expected at the polls, Hillary can\u2019t win, and if she does, Americans should definitely question how that could even happen", "label": "1"}, {"title": "Andrea Tantaros of Fox News Claims Retaliation for Sex Harassment Complaints - The New York Times", "author": "Jim Dwyer", "text": "Andrea Tantaros, a former Fox News host, charged in a lawsuit filed Monday that top executives at the network, including the man who replaced Roger Ailes, punished her for complaining about sexual harassment by Mr. Ailes. The suit by Ms. Tantaros, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is the latest round in a contentious volley that began in late winter, when Fox claimed she had breached her employment contract by writing a book without receiving network approval. \u201cFox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a   Playboy   cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,\u201d Ms. Tantaros\u2019s suit says. Fox News said it would not comment on pending litigation. Mr. Ailes, the network\u2019s founding chairman and guiding force for two decades, resigned last month after a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, said in a suit that she was fired for refusing his sexual advances. Mr. Ailes has denied all allegations of harassment. In April, the chief lawyer for Fox charged that Ms. Tantaros had concocted sexual harassment claims to gain leverage in the contract dispute her lawyer, Judd Burstein, said the book dispute was a pretext that Fox was using to silence her. During arbitration, Mr. Burstein said, Fox News offered to pay her a sum \u201cin the seven figures\u201d if she renounced claims against Mr. Ailes and others at the network, including the host Bill O\u2019Reilly. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Tantaros said she had been subjected to unwelcome advances from Mr. O\u2019Reilly, whom she had regarded as a friend and adviser. \u201cAiles did not act alone,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cHe may have been the primary culprit, but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants, who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by threats, humiliation and retaliation. \u201d Ms. Tantaros also claimed in the lawsuit that she was the subject of humiliating posts by pseudonymous accounts on Twitter known as \u201csock puppets\u201d that she says were instigated by the Fox News publicity department. Ms. Tantaros joined Fox as a contributor in 2010, and a year later was named   of \u201cThe Five,\u201d which aired at 5 p. m. She said in the suit that she was repeatedly told by Fox executives that she could not wear pants on the air because \u201cRoger wants to see your legs. \u201d The lawsuit goes on to say that on Aug. 12, 2014, Mr. Ailes called her into his office and asked if she was planning to marry and have children. \u201cAiles then started complaining about marriage in general, and also made   jokes about being married,\u201d the lawsuit states. It describes Mr. Ailes as speculating on the sexual habits and preferences of 10 Fox News personalities. He asked Ms. Tantaros to turn around \u201cso I can get a good look at you,\u201d the lawsuit charges, adding that Ms. Tantaros refused. Soon after, she was moved from \u201cThe Five\u201d to a   show, \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d that aired at midday. Mr. Ailes called her back for similar sessions in December 2014 and February 2015, the lawsuit charges, and when she continued to rebuff him, she encountered hostility from the Fox News publicity department. In the February meeting, she said, Mr. Ailes talked about how she would look in a bikini, and accused her of ending a   relationship because she had been merely using the man. The episode brought her to tears, the lawsuit states. She said the sole interview arranged by the publicity department during that period was with a writer for a blog controlled by Fox, who asked about her breasts and if she was difficult to work with. In April 2015, the lawsuit states, Ms. Tantaros met with Bill Shine, then a senior news executive and close aide to Mr. Ailes. She said that she told him about the meetings with Mr. Ailes and asked if he had told the head of publicity for Fox News, Irena Briganti, to go after her. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Shine \u201ctold Tantaros that Briganti is like a rabid dog on a chain that we can\u2019t control. Sometimes that dog gets off the chain. \u201d Then, pointing to a picture of Mr. Ailes on a magazine cover, the lawsuit charges, Mr. Shine told her that \u201cthis powerful man has faith in Irena Briganti\u201d and that Ms. Tantaros \u201cneeds to let this one go. \u201d Mr. Shine, through a spokeswoman, has said that Ms. Tantaros never approached him about Mr. Ailes harassing her.

The study was more like a den  \u2014   cozy and   lined with bookshelves that displayed mementos from Clinton\u2019s three decades in the public eye: a statue of her heroine, Eleanor Roosevelt a baseball signed by the Chicago Cubs star Ernie Banks a carved wooden figure of a pregnant African woman. The intimate setting lent itself to a   interview than the usual locale, her imposing outer office, with its marble fireplace, heavy drapes, crystal chandelier and ornate wall sconces. On the morning of Feb. 26, 2010, however, Clinton was talking about something more sensitive than mere foreign affairs: her relationship with Barack Obama. To say she chose her words carefully doesn\u2019t do justice to the delicacy of the exercise. She was like a   technician, deciding which color wire to snip without blowing up her relationship with the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed, I think, a very good rapport, really positive    about everything you can imagine,\u201d Clinton said about the man she described during the 2008 campaign as na\u00efve, irresponsible and hopelessly unprepared to be president. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had some interesting and even unusual experiences along the way. \u201d She leaned forward as she spoke, gesturing with her hands and laughing easily. In talking with reporters, Clinton displays more warmth than Obama does, though there\u2019s less of an expectation that she might say something revealing. Clinton singled out, as she often would, the United Nations   meeting in Copenhagen the previous December, where she and Obama worked together to save the meeting from collapse. She brought up the Middle East peace proc ess, a signature project of the president\u2019s, which she had been tasked with reviving. But she was understandably wary of talking about areas in which she and Obama split  \u2014   namely, on bedrock issues of war and peace, where Clinton\u2019s more activist philosophy had already collided in unpredictable ways with her boss\u2019s instincts toward restraint. She had backed Gen. Stanley McChrystal\u2019s recommendation to send 40, 000 more troops to Afghanistan, before endorsing a fallback proposal of 30, 000 (Obama went along with that, though he stipulated that the soldiers would begin to pull out again in July 2011, which she viewed as problematic). She supported the Pentagon\u2019s plan to leave behind a residual force of 10, 000 to 20, 000 American troops in Iraq (Obama balked at this, largely because of his inability to win legal protections from the Iraqis, a failure that was to haunt him when the Islamic State overran much of the country). And she pressed for the United States to funnel arms to the rebels in Syria\u2019s civil war (an idea Obama initially rebuffed before later, halfheartedly, coming around to it). That fundamental tension between Clinton and the president would continue to be a defining feature of her   tenure as secretary of state. In the administration\u2019s first   meeting on Russia in February 2009, aides to Obama proposed that the United States make some symbolic concessions to Russia as a gesture of its good will in resetting the relationship. Clinton, the last to speak, brusquely rejected the idea, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not giving up anything for nothing. \u201d Her hardheadedness made an impression on Robert Gates, the defense secretary and George W. Bush holdover who was wary of a changed Russia. He decided there and then that she was someone he could do business with. \u201cI thought, This is a tough lady,\u201d he told me. A few months after my interview in her office, another split emerged when Obama picked up a secure phone for a weekend conference call with Clinton, Gates and a handful of other advisers. It was July 2010, four months after the North Korean military torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, sinking it and killing 46 sailors. Now, after weeks of fierce debate between the Pentagon and the State Department, the United States was gearing up to respond to this brazen provocation. The tentative plan  \u2014   developed by Clinton\u2019s deputy at State, James Steinberg  \u2014   was to dispatch the aircraft carrier George Washington into coastal waters to the east of North Korea as an unusual show of force. But Adm. Robert Willard, then the Pacific commander, wanted to send the carrier on a more aggressive course, into the Yellow Sea, between North Korea and China. The Chinese foreign ministry had warned the United States against the move, which for Willard was all the more reason to press forward. He pushed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, who in turn pushed his boss, the defense secretary, to reroute the George Washington. Gates agreed, but he needed the commander in chief to sign off on a decision that could have political as well as military repercussions. Gates laid out the case for diverting the George Washington to the Yellow Sea: that the United States should not look as if it was yielding to China. Clinton strongly seconded it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to run it up the gut!\u201d she had said to her aides a few days earlier. (The Vince Lombardi imitation drew giggles from her staff, who, even 18 months into her tenure, still marveled at her pugnacity.) Obama, though, was not persuaded. The George Washington was already underway changing its course was not a decision to make on the fly. \u201cI don\u2019t call audibles with aircraft carriers,\u201d he said  \u2014   unwittingly   Clinton on her football metaphor. It wasn\u2019t the last debate in which she would side with Gates. The two quickly discovered that they shared a Midwestern upbringing, a taste for a stiff drink after a long day of work and a   skepticism about the intentions of America\u2019s foes. Bruce Riedel, a former intelligence analyst who conducted Obama\u2019s initial review on the Afghanistan war, says: \u201cI think one of the surprises for Gates and the military was, here they come in expecting a very    administration, and they discover that they have a secretary of state who\u2019s a little bit right of them on these issues  \u2014   a little more eager than they are, to a certain extent. Particularly on Afghanistan, where I think Gates knew more had to be done, knew more troops needed to be sent in, but had a lot of doubts about whether it would work. \u201d As Hillary Clinton makes another run for president, it can be tempting to view her   rhetoric about the world less as deeply felt core principle than as calculated political maneuver. But Clinton\u2019s   instincts are bred in the bone  \u2014   grounded in cold realism about human nature and what one aide calls \u201ca textbook view of American exceptionalism. \u201d It set her apart from her    Barack Obama, who avoided military entanglements and tried to reconcile Americans to a world in which the United States was no longer the undisputed hegemon. And it will likely set her apart from the Republican candidate she meets in the general election. For all their bluster about bombing the Islamic State into oblivion, neither Donald J. Trump nor Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has demonstrated anywhere near the appetite for military engagement abroad that Clinton has. \u201cHillary is very much a member of the traditional American   establishment,\u201d says Vali Nasr, a   strategist who advised her on Pakistan and Afghanistan at the State Department. \u201cShe believes, like presidents going back to the Reagan or Kennedy years, in the importance of the military  \u2014   in solving terrorism, in asserting American influence. The shift with Obama is that he went from reliance on the military to the intelligence agencies. Their position was, \u2018All you need to deal with terrorism is N. S. A. and C. I. A. drones and special ops.\u2019 So the C. I. A. gave Obama an angle, if you will, to be simultaneously hawkish and shun using the military. \u201d Unlike other recent presidents  \u2014   Obama, George W. Bush or her husband, Bill Clinton  \u2014   Hillary Clinton would assume the office with a long record on national security. There are many ways to examine that record, but one of the most revealing is to explore her   cultivation of the military  \u2014   not just civilian leaders like Gates, but also its   commanders, the men with the medals. Her affinity for the armed forces is rooted in a lifelong belief that the calculated use of military power is vital to defending national interests, that American intervention does more good than harm and that the writ of the United States properly reaches, as Bush once put it, into \u201cany dark corner of the world. \u201d Unexpectedly, in the bombastic,   presidential election of 2016, Hillary Clinton is the last true hawk left in the race. For those who know Clinton\u2019s biography, her embrace of the military should come as no surprise. She grew up in the buoyant aftermath of World War II, the daughter of a Navy petty officer who trained young sailors before they shipped out to the Pacific. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was a staunch Republican and an anticommunist, and she channeled his views. She talks often about her girlhood dream of becoming an astronaut, citing the rejection letter she got from NASA as the first time she encountered gender discrimination. Her real motive for volunteering, she has written, may have been because her father fretted that \u201cAmerica was lagging behind Russia. \u201d Political conversion came later, after Vietnam and the \u201960s swept over Wellesley College, where she spoke out against the establishment at her graduation. But even in the tumultuous year of 1968, she was still making her transition from Republican to Democrat, managing to go to the conventions of both parties. As a Republican intern in Washington that summer, she questioned a Wisconsin congressman, Melvin Laird, about the wisdom of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s escalating involvement in Southeast Asia. It was after law school that she had her most curious encounter with the military. In 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton, she stopped in at a Marine recruiting office in Arkansas to inquire about joining the active forces or reserves. She was a lawyer, she explained maybe there was some way she could serve. The recruiter, she recalled two decades later, was a young man of about 21, in prime physical condition. Clinton was then 27, freshly transplanted from Washington, teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and wearing   eyeglasses. \u201cYou\u2019re too old, you can\u2019t see and you\u2019re a woman,\u201d he told her. \u201cMaybe the dogs will take you,\u201d he added, in what she said was a pejorative reference to the Army. \u201cIt was not a very encouraging conversation,\u201d Clinton said at a lunch for military women on Capitol Hill in 1994. \u201cI decided, Maybe I\u2019ll look for another way to serve my country. \u201d Some reporters have cast doubt on the veracity of this story, which she repeated in the fall of 2015 over breakfast with voters in New Hampshire: certainly, there\u2019s no concrete evidence that it happened, and Bill gave a different account of it in 2008, substituting the Army for the Marines. Why would a professionally minded Yale Law graduate, on the cusp of marriage, suddenly want to put on a uniform? It\u2019s impossible to decipher her possible motives, but Ann Henry, an old friend who taught at the university after Clinton moved to Little Rock, offers a theory: During those days, she recalls, female faculty members, as an exercise, would test the boundaries of careers that appeared closed to women. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s made up,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was consistent with something she would have done. \u201d Clinton\u2019s next sustained exposure to the military did not come until she was first lady, almost two decades later. Living in the White House is, in many ways, like living in a military compound. A Marine stands guard in front of the West Wing when the president is in the Oval Office. The Mili tary Office operates the medical center and the telecommunications system. The Navy runs the cafeteria, the Marines transport the president by helicopter, the Air Force by plane. Camp David is a naval facility. The daily contact with men and women in uniform, Clinton\u2019s friends say, deepened her feelings for them. In March 1996, the first lady visited American troops stationed in Bosnia. The trip became notorious years later when she claimed, during the 2008 campaign, to have dodged sniper fire after her   military plane landed at an American base in Tuzla. (Chris Hill, a diplomat who was onboard that day and later served as ambassador to Iraq under Clinton, didn\u2019t remember snipers at all, and indeed recalled children handing her bouquets of spring flowers.) But there was no faking the good vibes during her tour of the mess and rec halls. With her teenage daughter at her side, she bantered and joked with the young servicemen and women  \u2014   an experience, she wrote, that \u201cleft lasting impressions on Chelsea and me. \u201d When Clinton was elected to the Senate, she had strong political reasons to care about the mili tary. The Pentagon was in the midst of a long, politically charged process of closing military bases New York State had already been a victim, when Plattsburgh Air Force Base was closed in 1995, a loss of 352 civilian jobs for that   North Country town. New York\u2019s delegation was determined to protect its remaining bases, especially Fort Drum, home of the Army\u2019s 10th Mountain Division, which sprawls over a hundred thousand acres in rural Jefferson County. In October 2001, a month after the   terrorist attacks, Clinton traveled to Fort Drum at the invitation of Gen. Buster Hagenbeck, who had just been named the division\u2019s commander and would be deployed to Afghanistan a month later. Like many of the officers I spoke with, he had preconceptions of Clinton from her years as first lady the woman who showed up at his office around happy hour that afternoon did not fulfill them. \u201cShe sat down,\u201d he recalls, \u201ctook her shoes off, put her feet up on the coffee table and said, \u2018General, do you know where a gal can get a cold beer around here? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d It was the start of a dialogue that stretched over two wars. In the spring of 2002, Hagenbeck led Operation Anaconda, a   assault on Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the    Valley that was the largest combat engagement of the war to date. When the general came back to Washington to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Clinton took him out to dinner on Capitol Hill for her own briefing. They also spoke about the Bush administration\u2019s preparations for war in Iraq, something which Hagenbeck was following anxiously. The general, it turned out, was more of a dove than the senator. He warned her about the risks of an invasion, which was then being   inside the Pentagon. It would be like \u201ckicking over a bee\u2019s nest,\u201d he said. Hagenbeck excused Clinton\u2019s vote in 2002 to authorize military action in Iraq. \u201cShe made a considered call,\u201d he says. And \u201cshe was chagrined, much after the fact. \u201d For him, what mattered more than Clinton\u2019s voting record was her unstinting public support of the military, whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first year in Afghanistan. Clinton\u2019s education in military affairs began in earnest in 2002, after the Democratic Party\u2019s crushing defeat in midterm elections moved her up several rungs in Senate seniority. The party\u2019s congressional leaders offered her a seat on either the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the Senate Armed Services Committee. She chose Armed Services, spurning a long tradition of New York senators, like Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jacob Javits, who coveted the prestige of Foreign Relations. Armed Services deals with more earthbound issues, like benefits for veterans, and it had long been the preserve of Republican hawks like John McCain. But after   Clinton saw Armed Services as better preparation for her future. For a politician looking to hone   credentials  \u2014   a woman who aspired to be commander in chief  \u2014   it was the perfect training ground. She dug in like a grunt at boot camp. Andrew Shapiro, then Senator Clinton\u2019s   adviser, called upon 10 experts  \u2014   including Bill Perry, who was defense secretary under her husband, and Ashton Carter, who would eventually become President Obama\u2019s fourth defense secretary  \u2014   to tutor her on everything from grand strategy to defense procurement. She met quietly with Andrew Marshall, an octogenarian strategist at the Pentagon who labored for decades in the blandly named Office of Net Assessment, earning the nickname Yoda for his Delphic insights. She went to every committee meeting, no matter how mundane. Aides recall her on   sitting alone in the chamber, patiently questioning a lieutenant colonel. She visited the troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving Day in 2003 and spoke at every significant military installation in New York State. By then  \u2014   30 years after she recalled being rejected by a Marine recruiter in Arkansas  \u2014   Hillary Clinton had become a military wonk. Jack Keane is one of the intellectual architects of the Iraq surge he is also perhaps the greatest single influence on the way Hillary Clinton thinks about military issues. A bear of a man with a jowly, careworn face and   hair, Keane exudes the supreme   you would expect of a retired   general. He speaks with a trace of a New York accent that gives his pronouncements a    urgency. He is also a   member of the   complex, sitting on the board of General Dynamics and serving as a strategic adviser to Academi, the   contractor once known as Blackwater. And he is the chairman of an aptly named think tank, the Institute for the Study of War. Though he is one of a parade of   generals, Keane is the resident hawk on Fox News, where he appears regularly to call for the United States to use greater military force in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. He doesn\u2019t shrink from putting boots on the ground and has little use for civilian leaders, like Obama, who do. Keane first got to know Clinton in the fall of 2001, when she was a freshman senator and he was the Army\u2019s second in command, with a distinguished combat and command record in Vietnam, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. He had expected her to be intelligent,   and politically astute, but he was not prepared for the respect she showed for the Army as an institution, or her sympathy for the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families. Keane was confident he could smell a phony politician a mile away, and he didn\u2019t get that whiff from her. \u201cI read people that\u2019s one of my strengths,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t be fooled, but I\u2019m not fooled often. \u201d Clinton took an instant liking to Keane, too. \u201cShe loves that Irish gruff thing,\u201d says one of her Senate aides, Kris Balderston, who was in the room that day. When Keane got up after 45 minutes to leave for a meeting back at the Pentagon with a Polish general, she protested that she wasn\u2019t finished yet and asked for another appointment. \u201cI said, \u2018O. K. but it took me three months to get this one,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Keane told her dryly. Clinton exploded into a raucous laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that problem,\u201d she promised. She was true to her word: The two would meet many times over the next decade, discussing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Iranian nu clear threat and other flash points in the Middle East. Sometimes he dropped by her Senate office other times they met for dinner or drinks. He escorted her on her first visit to Fort Drum and set up her first trip to Iraq. They generally agreed to forgo talk of politics, but at a meeting in Clinton\u2019s Senate office in January 2007, Keane tried to sell her on the logic of a troop surge in Iraq. The previous month, he had met with President Bush in the Oval Office to recommend that the United States deploy five to eight Army and Marine brigades to wage an urban counterinsurgency campaign only that, he argued, would stabilize a country being ripped apart by sectarian strife. His presentation angered some of Keane\u2019s fellow generals, who feared that such a strategy would deepen Iraq\u2019s dependency and prolong America\u2019s involvement. But it had a big impact on the commander in chief, who soon ordered more than 20, 000 additional troops to Iraq. Clinton was another story. \u201cI\u2019m convinced it\u2019s not going to work, Jack,\u201d she told him. She predicted that the American soldiers patrolling in Iraqi cities and towns would be \u201cblown up\u201d by Sunni militias or Al Qaeda fighters. \u201cShe thought we would fail,\u201d Keane recalls, \u201cand it was going to cause increased casualties. \u201d Politics, of course, was also on her mind. Barack Obama was laying the groundwork for his candidacy in   with a campaign that would emphasize his opposition to the Iraq War and her vote in favor of it  \u2014   a vote that still shadows her in this year\u2019s Democratic primaries. Obama was setting off on a   drive that would net $25 million in three months, sending tremors through Clinton\u2019s political camp and establishing him as a formidable rival. Although she disagreed with Keane about Iraq, Clinton asked him to become a formal adviser. \u201cAs much as I respect you,\u201d he replied, \u201cI can\u2019t do that. \u201d Keane\u2019s wife had health problems that had moved up his retirement from the Army, and he did not, as a policy, endorse candidates. Sometime during 2008  \u2014   he doesn\u2019t remember exactly when  \u2014   Clinton told him she had erred in doubting the wisdom of the surge. \u201cShe said, \u2018You were right, this really did work,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Keane recalls. \u201cOn issues of national security,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought she was always intellectually honest with me. \u201d He and Clinton continued to talk, even after Obama was elected and she became secretary of state. More often than not, they found themselves in sync. Keane, like Clinton, favored more robust intervention in Syria than Obama did. In April 2015, the week before she announced her candidacy, Clinton asked him for a briefing on military options for dealing with the fighters of the Islamic State. Bringing along three young female analysts from the Institute for the Study of War, Keane gave her a     presentation. Among other steps, he advocated imposing a   zone over parts of Syria that would neutralize the air power of the Syrian president, Bashar   with a goal of forcing him into a political settlement with opposition groups. Six months later, Clinton publicly adopted this position, further distancing herself from Obama. \u201cI\u2019m convinced this president, no matter what the circumstances, will never put any boots on the ground to do anything, even when it\u2019s compelling,\u201d Keane told me. He was sitting in the library at his home in McLean, Va. which is lined with books on military history and strategy. His critique of Obama was hardly new or original, but much of it mirrors the thinking of Clinton and her policy advisers. \u201cOne of the problems the president has, which weakens his diplomatic efforts, is that leaders don\u2019t believe he would use military power. That\u2019s an issue that would separate the president from Hillary Clinton rather dramatically. She would look at military force as another realistic option, but only where there is no other option. \u201d Befriending Keane wasn\u2019t just about cultivating a single adviser. It gave Clinton instant entree to his informal network of   and retired generals. The most interesting by far was David Petraeus, a cerebral commander who shared Clinton\u2019s   ambition and whose life stories would mix heady success with humbling setbacks. Both would be accused of mishandling classified information  \u2014   Clinton because of her use of a private server and email address to conduct sensitive government business, a decision that erupted into a political scandal Petraeus because he had given a diary containing classified information to his biographer and mistress (he was eventually charged with a misdemeanor for mishandling classified information). On Clinton\u2019s first trip to Iraq in November 2003, Petraeus, then a   general commanding the 101st Airborne Division, flew from his field headquarters in Mosul to the relative safety of Kirkuk to brief her congressional delegation. \u201cShe was full of questions,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was the kind of gesture that means a lot to a battlefield commander. \u201d On subsequent trips, as he rose in rank, Petraeus walked her through his plans to train and equip Iraqi Army troops, a forerunner of the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It worked to their mutual benefit: Petraeus was building ties to a prominent Democratic voice in the Senate Clinton was burnishing her image as a friend of the troops. \u201cShe did it the   way,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did it by pursuing relationships. \u201d When Petraeus was sent back to Iraq as the top commander in early 2007, he gave every member of the Senate Armed Services Committee a copy of the U. S.   Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, which he edited during a tour at Fort Leavenworth. Clinton read hers from cover to cover. Although Clinton\u2019s reservations about the surge were valid  \u2014   the stability that the additional troops brought to Iraq didn\u2019t last  \u2014   her opposition to it, like her vote for the war, came back to haunt her. This time, it was her ally Bob Gates who summoned the ghost. In his memoirs, Gates wrote that she confessed to him and the president that her position had been politically motivated, because she was then facing Obama in the Iowa caucuses. (Obama, he wrote, \u201cvaguely\u201d conceded that he, too, had opposed it for political reasons.) Clinton pushed back, telling Diane Sawyer of ABC News that Gates \u201cperhaps either missed the context or the meaning, because I did oppose the surge. \u201d Her opposition, she told Sawyer, was driven by the fact that at that time, people were not going to accept any escalation of the war. \u201cThis is not politics in electoral, political terms,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is politics in the sense of the American public has to support commitments like this. \u201d The next time she found herself in a debate over sending troops into harm\u2019s way, she voiced no such reservations. \u201cWe need maps,\u201d Hillary Clinton told her aides. It was early October 2009, and she had just returned from a meeting in the Situation Room. Obama\u2019s war cabinet was debating how many additional troops to send to Afghanistan, where the United States, preoccupied by Iraq, had allowed the Taliban to regroup. The Pentagon, she reported, had used impressive,   maps to show its plans to deploy troops around the country. The attention to detail made Gates and his commanders look crisp and well prepared the State Department, which was pushing a \u201ccivilian surge\u201d to accompany the troops, looked wan by comparison. At the next meeting, on Oct. 14, the team from State unfurled its own maps to show the deployment of an army of aid workers, diplomats, legal experts and crop specialists who were supposed to follow the soldiers into Afghanistan. Clinton\u2019s fixation with maps was typical of her   in the first great    debate of the Obama presidency. She wanted to be taken seriously, even if her department was less central than the Pentagon. One way to do that was by promoting the civilian surge, the pet project of her friend and special envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke. \u201cShe was determined that her briefing books would be just as thick and just as meticulous as those of the Pentagon,\u201d a senior adviser recalls. She also didn\u2019t hesitate to get into the Pentagon\u2019s business, asking detailed questions about the training of Afghan troops and wading into the weeds of military planning. She resolved not to miss out on anything  \u2014   a determination that may have been rooted in a deeper insecurity about her role in what was to become the most White   administration of the modern era. On the morning of June 8, 2009, she emailed two aides to say: \u201cI heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go? If not, who are we sending?\u201d On Feb. 10, 2010, she dialed the White House from her home, but couldn\u2019t get past the switchboard operator, who didn\u2019t believe she was really Hillary Clinton. Asked to provide her office number to prove her identity, she said she didn\u2019t know it. Finally, Clinton hung up in frustration and placed the call again through the State Department Operations Center  \u2014   \u201clike a proper and properly dependent secretary of state,\u201d as she later wrote to one aide in a   tone. \u201cNo independent dialing allowed. \u201d The Afghan troop debate, a   drama of dueling egos, leaked documents and endless deliberations, is typically framed as a test of wills between the Pentagon\u2019s wily military commanders and an inexperienced young president, with Joe Biden playing the role of devil\u2019s advocate for Obama. While that portrait is accurate, it neglects the role of Clinton. By siding with Gates and the generals, she gave political ballast to their proposals and provided a bullish counterpoint to Biden\u2019s skepticism. Her role should not be overstated: She did not turn the debate, nor did she bring to it any distinctive point of view. But her unstinting support of General McChrystal\u2019s maximalist recommendation made it harder for Obama to choose a lesser option. (McChrystal was later fired by Obama after his aides made derogatory remarks about almost every member of his war cabinet to Rolling Stone magazine she was the exception. \u201cHillary had Stan\u2019s back,\u201d one of his aides told the reporter, Michael Hastings.) \u201cHillary was adamant in her support for what Stan asked for,\u201d Gates says. \u201cShe made clear that she was ready to support his request for the full 40, 000 troops. She then made clear that she was only willing to go with the 30, 000 number because I proposed it. She was, in a way, tougher on the numbers in the surge than I was. \u201d Gates believed that if he could align Clinton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen the commander of Central Command, David Petraeus and himself behind a common position, it would be hard for Obama to say no. \u201cHow could you ignore these Four Horsemen of national security?\u201d says Geoff Morrell, who served as the Pentagon press secretary at the time. Just as Clinton benefited from her alliance with the military commanders, she gave them political cover. \u201cHere\u2019s the dirty little secret,\u201d says Tom Nides, her former deputy secretary of state for management and resources. \u201cThey all knew they wanted her on their side. They knew that if they walked into the Situation Room and they had her, it made a huge difference in the dynamics. When she opened her mouth, she could change the momentum in the room. \u201d David Axelrod recalls one meeting where Clinton \u201ckicked the thing off and pretty much articulated their opinion I\u2019m sure that\u2019s one that they remember. There\u2019s no doubt that she wanted to give them every troop that McChrystal was asking for. \u201d Still, Clinton didn\u2019t prevail on every argument. After agreeing to send the troops, Obama added a condition of his own: that the soldiers be deployed as quickly as possible and pulled out again, starting in the summer of 2011  \u2014   a deadline that proved more fateful in the long run than a difference of 10, 000 troops. Clinton opposed setting a public deadline for withdrawal, arguing that it would tip America\u2019s hand to the Taliban and encourage them to wait out the United States  \u2014   which, in fact, was exactly what happened. In the final days of the debate, Clinton also found herself at odds with her own ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry. He, too, held different views than she did on the wisdom of a surge, which he put into writing. On Nov. 6, 2009, in a long cable addressed to Clinton  \u2014   and later leaked to The New York Times  \u2014   he made a trenchant, convincing case for why the McChrystal proposal, which she endorsed two weeks earlier in a meeting with Obama, would saddle the United States with \u201cvastly increased costs and an indefinite,   military role in Afghanistan. \u201d Much of Eikenberry\u2019s analysis proved prescient, particularly his warnings about the threadbare American partnership with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. It carried an extra sting because he was a retired   Army general who was the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007. Clinton, who had not asked for the cable, was furious, fearing it could upset a debate in which she and the Pentagon were about to prevail. What the cable made clear was the degree to which the Afghanistan debate was dominated by military considerations. While Clinton did raise the need to deal with Afghanistan\u2019s neighbor, Pakistan, her reflexive support of Gates, Petraeus and McChrystal meant she was not a powerful voice for diplomatic alternatives. \u201cShe contributed to the overmilitarizing of the analysis of the problem,\u201d says Sarah Chayes, who was an adviser to McChrystal and later to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen. In October 2015, the persistent violence in Afghanistan and the legacy of Karzai\u2019s misrule forced Obama to reverse his plan to withdraw the last American soldiers by the end of his presi dency. A few thousand troops will stay there indefinitely. And for all of Clinton\u2019s talk about a civilian surge, it never really materialized. For Clinton, the Afghanistan episode laid bare a vexed relationship between her and Eikenberry, one of the few generals with whom she didn\u2019t hit it off. A   with graduate degrees from Harvard and Stanford, Eikenberry was brilliant but had a reputation among his colleagues for being imperious. Clinton had a similarly chilly relationship with Douglas Lute, another Army lieutenant general with a graduate degree from Harvard, who also fought with Holbrooke. \u201cShe likes the    \u2014   McChrystal, Petraeus, Keane,\u201d one of her aides observes. \u201cReal military guys, not these retired   who go into civilian jobs. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Hillary Clinton\u2019s more muscular brand of American foreign policy is better matched to 2016 than it was to 2008,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, her top policy adviser at the State Department, who plays the same role in her campaign. It was De cem ber 2015, 53 days before the Iowa caucuses, and Sullivan was sitting down with me in Clinton\u2019s sprawling Brooklyn headquarters to explain how she was shaping her message for a campaign suddenly dominated by concerns about national security. Clinton\u2019s strategy, he said, was twofold: Explain to voters that she had a clear plan for confronting the threat posed by Islamic terrorism, and expose her Republican opponents as utterly lacking in experience or credibility on national security. There were good reasons for Clinton to let her inner hawk fly. After the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. Americans\u2019 concern about a major attack on the nation spiked. A   poll taken after Paris showed that a majority, 53 percent, favored sending ground troops to Iraq or Syria, a remarkable shift from the   sentiment that prevailed during most of Obama\u2019s presidency. The Republican candidates were reaching for apocalyptic metaphors to demonstrate their resolve. Ted Cruz threatened to   the Islamic State to test whether desert sand can glow Donald Trump called for the United States to ban all Muslims from entering the country \u201cuntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses. \u201d Yet such spikes in the public appetite for mili tary action tend to be transitory. Three weeks later, the same poll showed an even split, at 49 percent, on whether to deploy troops. Neither Trump nor Cruz favors major new deployments of American soldiers to Iraq and Syria (nor, for that matter, does Clinton). If anything, both are more skeptical than Clinton about intervention and more circumspect than she about maintaining the nation\u2019s   War II military commitments. Trump loudly proclaims his opposition to the Iraq War. He wants the United States to spend less to underwrite NATO and has talked about withdrawing the American security umbrella from Asia, even if that means Japan and South Korea would acquire nuclear weapons to defend themselves. Cruz, unlike Clinton, opposed aiding the Syrian rebels in 2014. He once supported Pentagon budget constraints advocated by his isolationist colleague, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Thus might the gen eral election present voters with an unfamiliar choice: a Democratic hawk versus a Republican reluctant warrior. To thwart the progressive insurgency of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton carefully calibrated her message during the Democratic primaries to align herself closely with Barack Obama and his racially diverse coalition. But as she pivots to the general election, that balancing act with Obama will become trickier. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a huge amount of interest in the press to \u201d Sullivan says. \u201cIt just so easily can become a sport that distracts from her ability to make an affirmative case. \u201d In showing her stripes as a prospective commander in chief, Clinton will no doubt draw heavily upon her State Department experience  \u2014   filtering the lessons she learned in Libya, Syria and Iraq into the sinewy worldview she has held since childhood. Last fall, in a series of policy speeches, Clinton began limning distinctions with the president on national security. She said the United States should consider sending more   troops to Iraq than Obama had committed, to help the Iraqis and Kurds fight the Islamic State. She came out in favor of a partial   zone over Syria. And she described the threat posed by ISIS to Americans in starker terms than he did. As is often the case with Clinton and Obama, the differences were less about direction than degree. She wasn\u2019t calling for ground troops in the Middle East, any more than he was. Clinton insisted her plan was not a break with his, merely an \u201cintensification and acceleration\u201d of it. It\u2019s an open question how well Clinton\u2019s hawkish instincts match the country\u2019s mood. Americans are weary of war and remain suspicious of foreign entanglements. And yet, after the retrenchment of the Obama years, there is polling evidence that they are equally dissatisfied with a portrait of their country as a spent force, managing its decline amid a world of rising powers like China, resurgent empires like Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and lethal new forces like the Islamic State. If Obama\u2019s minimalist approach was a necessary reaction to the maximalist style of his predecessor, then perhaps what Americans yearn for is something in between  \u2014   the kind of   pragmatism that Clinton has spent a lifetime honing. \u201cThe president has made some tough decisions,\u201d says Leon Panetta, who served as Obama\u2019s defense secretary after Bob Gates, and as director of the C. I. A. before David Petraeus. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a mixed record, and the concern is, the president defining what America\u2019s role in the world is in the 21st century hasn\u2019t happened. \u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll do it,\u201d he added, acknowledging the time Obama has left. \u201cCertainly, she would. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Chuck Todd to BuzzFeed EIC: \u2019You Just Published Fake News\u2019 - Breitbart", "author": "Ian Hanchett", "text": "During a discussion of BuzzFeed\u2019s story on a dossier regarding Russia and   Donald Trump on Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMTP Daily,\u201d host Chuck Todd told BuzzFeed    Ben Smith \u201cyou just published fake news. \u201d  Todd said BuzzFeed\u2019s decision to publish the dossier was an instance where they \u201cwould not have made the same decision in the   era. \u201d Smith stated that it was more \u201cthe   era. \u201d And that there was a time \u201cwhere we could act as gatekeepers.

It noted two specific errors. \u201d Todd then asked if BuzzFeed had a responsibility to not spread false information. Smith responded that, like with the Obama birth certificate issue, it\u2019s a \u201cdifficult balance that everybody in our business navigates every day. \u201d Todd then asked if BuzzFeed would publish a false birth certificate. Smith answered, \u201cWe certainly quoted the   of the United States making false claims about it, and years ago we debated whether we should quote regular citizens in Iowa saying, I don\u2019t believe his birth certificate. And I remember us thinking at first, we probably shouldn\u2019t. That we we shouldn\u2019t pass that on and then saying, you know what, this has become a force that is impacting the conversation. \u201d Todd countered, \u201cI know this was not your intent. I\u2019ve known you a long time, but you just published fake news. \u201d Smith countered that people throw the term \u201cfake news\u201d around to diminish things they don\u2019t like, and that \u201cthis was a real story about a real document that was really being passed around between the very top officials of this country. And then the question you say is, okay, it\u2019s okay for you  \u2014   to Chuck Todd see this document. It\u2019s okay for me to see it. Okay for Senator John McCain ( ). Okay for the CIA. What\u2019s  \u2014   why is it not okay for your audience?\u201d Todd then countered that BuzzFeed could have published a redacted version of the document. Smith answered that there was fair disagreement, but didn\u2019t think you could defend acknowledging the dossier\u2019s existence but then not say what was in it and that this was saying it was okay to summarize false claims. Smith further stated that if there wasn\u2019t a \u201cpublic conversation\u201d about the dossier, they would have just continued to report the story out.

In the days since Britain voted to leave the bloc, the movement\u2019s leaders have often appeared as if they had not expected to win and were not prepared to cope with the consequences. Faced with the scope of the decision, they have been busy walking back promises they made during the campaign and scaling back expectations. They have failed to show a united front or to answer basic questions. Their faltering performance has added to the sense of political chaos in Britain and, arguably, to the turmoil in the financial markets. And it has undercut their credibility and authority as Mr. Johnson prepares his bid to become prime minister and lead Britain into a new relationship with the Continent. The stakes are high for Mr. Johnson in particular, as he tries to build an impression as a capable leader amid the chaos that followed the vote in favor of a British exit, or \u201cBrexit. \u201d But the mixed signals coming from him and other proponents of leaving the European Union have left their intentions unclear on such basic issues as when and how they will seek to negotiate a withdrawal, and what kind of new arrangement they want. To the degree that they have signaled a direction, it has often been substantially different from what they promised during the campaign. On issues from immigration to spending on the National Health Service, the \u201cLeave\u201d coalition has retreated from its more populist and apparently exaggerated claims. Many of those assertions had been promoted by the   U. K. Independence Party, or UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, and benefited the broader Leave campaign, whose most prominent figures included two senior Conservatives, Mr. Johnson and Michael Gove, the justice minister. In changing their tune, the leaders of the   Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union  \u2014   which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds, or $465 million, a week  \u2014   would be available to help finance the National Health Service. For example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the \u00a3350 million a week to the health service. Instead, he said, \u201cthe lion\u2019s share\u201d of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services. On immigration, too, there was immediate backtracking from Mr. Johnson and Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament from the Conservative Party, who told the BBC, \u201cFrankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E. U. they are going to be disappointed. \u201d Analysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce, but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr. Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign, especially with populist sentiment spreading and   groups like the U. K. Independence Party eager to build support. \u201cThere is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent. \u201cIf they don\u2019t deliver radical reforms on immigration, it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010. \u201d In his regular column in The Daily Telegraph on Monday, Mr. Johnson tried to strike a prime ministerial tone of unity in the wake of the divisive referendum, but he emphasized continuity over change and tried to argue that immigration, clearly the primary motivation for many voters in taking a position against Europe, was somehow not a major issue. \u201cIt is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote. \u201cI do not believe that is so. \u201d Suggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe, Mr. Johnson wrote, \u201cBritish people will still be able to go and work in the E. U. to live to travel to study to buy homes and to settle down. \u201d Not only that, he asserted, \u201cThere will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market. \u201d What he described was a relationship with the European Union like that of Norway, which would allow freedom of movement and labor and would pay money to Brussels in return for access to the single market, but without having a voice in  . But Mr. Johnson rejected the Norway model during the campaign, and even if negotiations proved to lead to a slightly enhanced Norway, with some symbolic measures to restrict immigration of European Union citizens to Britain, the result would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave. And right now, Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member. \u201cThe difficulty for Boris and Gove is that Brexit feels like a column gone wrong, an academic exercise suddenly turned into reality,\u201d Paul Waugh wrote in his blog for The Huffington Post, alluding to the shared backgrounds in journalism of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove. \u201cAnd reality, particularly where the E. U. is concerned, is a messy, complex thing. \u201d Mr. Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own, flamboyant self and to burnish his   economic credentials. But playing down immigration, Mr. Goodwin said, could create more political trouble. \u201cI worry for senior euroskeptic leaders, because there is a misunderstanding of the vote, and that will feed voter dissatisfaction,\u201d he said, driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right. The referendum was unusual, because it pitted a government on one side, \u201cRemain,\u201d against a loose coalition on the other, made up of Conservatives, some Labour legislators and U. K. Independence Party supporters. The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. \u201cThere was no coherence, because it wasn\u2019t a political party fighting for government, but an odd coalition fighting against something, but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for,\u201d he said. Even on the economy, the Leave side was made of   economists who believe in no tariffs at all, those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization, Professor Travers said. \u201cAnd now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both, a   government that must reflect the schism in itself,\u201d he said. In the aftermath of the Leave campaign\u2019s victory, the political editor for Sky News, Faisal Islam, asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his camp\u2019s plan. The legislator replied, according to Mr. Islam: \u201cThere is no plan. The Leave campaign don\u2019t have a   plan. \u201d Then the legislator added, \u201cNumber 10 should have had a plan,\u201d referring to the prime minister\u2019s office.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Texas Oil Fields Rebound From Price Lull, but Jobs Are Left Behind - The New York Times", "author": "Clifford Krauss", "text": "MIDLAND, Tex.  \u2014   In the land where oil jobs were once a guaranteed road to security for   workers, Eustasio Velazquez\u2019s career has been upended by technology. For 10 years, he laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher. Then, powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection, and he lost his job. He found new work connecting pipes on rigs, but lost that job, too, when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller he worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper, more reliable automated tools. \u201cI don\u2019t see a future,\u201d Mr. Velazquez, 44, said on a recent afternoon as he stooped over his shopping cart at a local grocery store. \u201cPretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot. \u201d Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the     jobs  \u2014   just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back. But the West Texas oil fields, where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound, illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal. As in other industries, automation is creating a new demand for   workers  \u2014   sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center  \u2014   but their numbers don\u2019t offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron. So while there is a general sense of relief in the oil patch that a recovery is gaining momentum, discussions at company meetings and family kitchen tables are rife with aching worries, especially among those who are   with no more than a high school education. Roughly 163, 000 oil jobs were lost nationally from the 2014 peak, or about 30 percent of the total, while oil prices plummeted, at one point by as much as 70 percent. The job losses just in Texas, the most productive   state, totaled 98, 000. Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again, but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning. Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy, like wind power. \u201cPeople have left the industry, and they are not coming back,\u201d said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs. \u201cIf it\u2019s a repetitive task, it can be automated, and I don\u2019t need someone to do that. I can get a computer to do that. \u201d Indeed, computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually. The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time  \u2014   onshore or miles out to sea  \u2014   and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong, all without leaving their desks. It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure, reducing the need for a technician to check. And despite all the lost workers, United States oil production is galloping upward, to nine million barrels a day from 8. 6 million in September. Nationwide, with a bit more than   as many rigs operating as in 2014, production is not even down 10 percent from record levels. Some of the best wells here in the Permian Basin that three years ago required an oil price of over $60 a barrel for an operator to break even now need about $35, well below the current price of about $53. Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries, along with deepwater oil exploration, over more than a decade. But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business. All the big companies, and many smaller ones, have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them to duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over, and to repair valves and other parts before they break down. The result is improved production and safety, but also a far smaller work force, and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power. Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the most productive West Texas producers, has slashed the number of days to drill and complete wells so drastically that it has been able to cut costs by 25 percent in wells completed since early 2015. The typical rig that drilled eight to 12 wells a year just a few years ago now drills up to 16. Last year, the company added nearly 240 wells to its Permian Basin inventory without adding new employees. The faster operations, Pioneer executives say, are due in large part to more effective well planning and drill steering. Both have been made possible by the   computer connections between the rig and top geoscientists back at corporate headquarters and intense analysis of the data gathered at every well. The laborious task of checking tank levels by climbing a flight of steps and popping open a series of latches, for instance, has been replaced by pressing a few icons on a computer touch screen. A fully automated water pump station installed last summer is intended to save hundreds of truck trips every day hauling water for hydraulically fracturing wells, yielding diesel and labor cost savings. \u201cWe want to transform our work force to the point where we need to hire fewer people,\u201d said Joey Hall, Pioneer\u2019s executive vice president for Permian operations. Improved computing streamlines operations, he noted, and lets technicians optimally space their wells and more accurately perforate the sweet spots of shale veins to squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground. \u201cWe\u2019re heading toward artificial intelligence and machine learning, analyzing thousands of algorithms,\u201d Mr. Hall added, sounding more like a Silicon Valley futurologist than a wildcatter. \u201cThrough repetitive operations, you learn the patterns, and through patterns you learn to make automated decisions. \u201d With the loss of manual jobs has come a transformation in the job force, with demand growing for more data analysts, math scientists, communications specialists and robotic design engineers. In the last two years, ABB, the Swiss technology company, has opened two plants in Houston for assembling and packaging robotics and integrating advanced instrumentation into oil field operations. GE Oil and Gas opened a technology center in Oklahoma City in October to place scientists closer to the oil fields to research and apply new digital industrial technologies for exploration and production. Among its many projects is an experiment to use drones to inspect equipment and identify methane leaks on oil sites. Nabors, the oil services giant, has 100 employees developing software, 10 times the number it had only a few years ago. \u201cWith the adoption of all this   software and stuff, we\u2019ve had to bring in a lot of new technicians,\u201d said Dennis A. Smith, a Nabors vice president. A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel, a    mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources. In less than two years, he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the best designs for hydraulic fracturing, optimizing the amounts of fluids, sand and chemicals pumped into the wells. Now, connected by computers to technicians in the field, he is monitoring the production of 950 wells, instantly checking the maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse. \u201cI\u2019m lucky and happy that the tech revolution in the oil field has created the need for engineers like me with backgrounds in computer science,\u201d he said. But smaller companies and their workers are struggling to keep up. S. O. C. Industries, a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider, is forced to invest $100, 000 a year to keep up with the computer programs and monitoring equipment its clients request. The added expenses are one reason the company has let go 15 of the 60 field workers employed three years ago. Another is that well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills are now hiring only three as mechanization has sliced their drilling time in half. Some of the remaining S. O. C. employees are straining to keep up with new computerized pump truck monitors and GPS systems. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle,\u201d said Rodrigo Urias, 59, an S. O. C. truck driver, who for many years only had to look at a needle on a gauge to monitor flow pressures. Now he needs to reset computer screens, take work orders on a computer tablet and sometimes do algebraic calculations. \u201cA lot of the guys can\u2019t operate these new technologies, tablets and instruments, and they keep whining,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want to know why we can\u2019t do things like we used to. \u201d Manufacturing executives say they are trying to minimize the complexity for field workers, and sometimes design their equipment with the advice of video game makers. That\u2019s a good thing for Michael Manga, 34, an employee of Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma company active here. A college dropout, he knocked around from job to job before finding his way to the oil patch. Now, playing video games like Call of Duty and Mario Kart with his friends over the years has paid off, giving him the   coordination to monitor and operate the control panels and joy sticks that control the drilling rig. \u201cWe do such a good job now,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re drilling ourselves out of a job. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Bayer Deal for Monsanto Follows Agribusiness Trend, Raising Worries for Farmers - The New York Times", "author": "Leslie Picker, Danny Hakim and Michael J. de la Merced", "text": "Don Halcomb, a    farmer in Adairville, Ky. is expecting his profit to vanish this year, largely because of the confluence of falling crop prices and rising costs for seeds and other materials. The price of an   bag of seed corn rose to $300 from $80 in the last decade, as the companies that produced them consolidated, he said. And with the recent decline in commodity prices, Mr. Halcomb said he expects to lose $100 an acre this year. \u201cWe\u2019re producing our crops at a loss now, just like the oil guys are pumping oil at a loss,\u201d Mr. Halcomb, who grows corn, soybeans, wheat and barley on his   family farm, said by telephone on Wednesday. \u201cYou can\u2019t cut your costs fast enough. \u201d It is a common plight of farmers across the United States, with the global agriculture industry in a wrenching downturn. Because farmers have produced too much corn, wheat and soybeans, they have been forced to slash prices to sell their crops. They have also reduced spending on seeds, pesticides and fertilizer, which has eaten into sales at agribusiness giants, including Monsanto and DuPont. In response, these companies have sought   deals to cut costs and weather the industry\u2019s storm. Four major agribusiness mergers have been announced in the last year. The latest is Bayer AG\u2019s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto  \u2014   the largest acquisition of 2016  \u2014   announced on Wednesday. Every merger creates the possibility of higher costs for farmers. Mr. Halcomb buys seeds with traits licensed to Monsanto of St. Louis and seeds from DuPont, which has a deal pending to merge with Dow Chemical. His fertilizers are made of potassium compounds and phosphate produced by Agrium of Calgary, Alberta, which on Monday agreed to combine with the fertilizer producer Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. He uses pesticides made by Syngenta of Switzerland, which agreed in February to a takeover by the China National Chemical Corporation. \u201cIt\u2019s just like any other industry that consolidates,\u201d Mr. Halcomb said. \u201cThey tell the regulators they\u2019re   and then they tell their customers they have to increase pricing after the deal\u2019s done. \u201d The companies say they are merging to diversify and increase growth and research capabilities, but these deals, given their size and scope, have already caught the attention of lawmakers and regulators in Washington. There is no guarantee that they will all receive regulatory approval, and some companies may have to sell assets to allay antitrust concerns. Dow\u2019s merger with DuPont is under Justice Department review. The market seemed to anticipate hurdles for the Monsanto deal on Wednesday. Shares of the company closed about 20 percent lower than the $128 per share cash offer from Bayer, which is based in Leverkusen, Germany. Shares of each company gained less than 1 percent after the deal was announced. Adding the assumption of about $10 billion of Monsanto debt, Bayer\u2019s total $66 billion pact is the largest   deal, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters, ahead of InBev\u2019s $60. 4 billion offer for another St.   company,   in June 2008. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, scheduled a hearing next week to discuss the possible effect of these   mergers on farming. Iowa produced more corn last year than any other state, according to the National Corn Growers Association. \u201cIt seems to be catching fire and happening so fast with so many,\u201d Senator Grassley said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen you have less competition, prices go up. \u201d European competition regulators also said publicly, before a   deal was even signed, that they would look at how it could affect prices and the availability of seed products, as well as research. Liam Condon, who leads Bayer\u2019s   division, said in an interview that the company did an \u201cextensive analysis\u201d with regard to antitrust before approaching Monsanto in May. Mr. Condon said that he does not believe there is much overlap between their portfolios, because Bayer\u2019s focus is largely on crop protection, while Monsanto\u2019s is on seeds and traits. He said the companies assume they may need to sell off some assets to appease regulators. Monsanto, which is famous for its production of genetically modified seeds, rejected several offers from Bayer as too low. Wednesday\u2019s deal represented a 44 percent premium to Monsanto\u2019s stock price on May 9, the day before Bayer\u2019s interest in a deal surfaced. To assuage Monsanto\u2019s concerns, Bayer threw in a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal fell apart on antitrust grounds. The strategic goal of the deal, according to Bill Selesky, an analyst at Argus Research, is to create a    experience for farmers, making Bayer the world\u2019s largest supplier of seeds and farm chemicals. By improving the product for farmers, the combined company could ultimately raise prices, Mr. Selesky said in an interview. Senator Grassley said that he had spoken with a few farmers who believed the deals were necessary so large agribusinesses could continue to absorb the costs of researching and developing products and getting government approval for them. Bayer and Monsanto said they planned to cut about $1. 2 billion worth of costs as part of the deal, helping to improve efficiency. But Jim Benham of Versailles, Ind. the president of the Indiana Farmers Union, was not so optimistic. He blamed the rising costs of inputs  \u2014   seeds, fertilizer and the like  \u2014   for eating away at farmers\u2019 profit margins, and warned that consolidation will make it worse. Costs have already risen by double digits over the last four to five years, and the proposed   merger could accelerate that. \u201cThe merger is going to hurt the farmer,\u201d said Mr. Benham, who grows corn, soybeans and sometimes wheat on his   farm. \u201cThe more consolidation we have on our inputs, the worse it gets. \u201d Mr. Condon of Bayer said that the company would not raise prices without providing more value to farmers. \u201cThis is a highly competitive industry, and just increasing prices without having any additional advantage or benefit for growers won\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to show what we\u2019re offering will help farmers improve their return on investment. \u201d Some farmers said the consolidation could even enable prices to fall. Christine Hamilton manages a farm of more than 12, 000 acres in Kimball, S. D. growing crops like corn and operating a ranch. She said that if the deal can pass the antitrust screening, then maybe it could actually help farmers. \u201cI understand how companies need to get bigger in order to be competitive,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we are in a low part of the cycle, anything that might have a chance of reducing our input prices would be great. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Russia Moves to Ban Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as \u2018Extremist\u2019 - The New York Times", "author": "Andrew Higgins", "text": "VOROKHOBINO, Russia  \u2014   A dedicated pacifist who has never even held a gun, Andrei Sivak discovered that his government considered him a dangerous extremist when he tried to change some money and the teller \u201csuddenly looked up at me with a face full of fear. \u201d His name had popped up on the exchange bureau\u2019s computer system, along with those of members of Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other militant groups responsible for shocking acts of violence. The only group the    father of three has ever belonged to, however, is Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a Christian denomination committed to the belief that the Bible must be taken literally, particularly its injunction \u201cThou shalt not kill. \u201d Yet, in a throwback to the days of the Soviet Union, when Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were hounded as spies and malcontents by the K. G. B. the denomination is at the center of an escalating campaign by the authorities to curtail religious groups that compete with the Russian Orthodox Church and that challenge President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s efforts to rally the country behind traditional and often militaristic patriotic values. The Justice Ministry, in a preliminary adminstrative strike last month, put the headquarters of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia, an office complex near St. Petersburg, on a list of the bodies banned \u201cin connection with the carrying out of extremist activities. \u201d Whether it stays there will depend on Russia\u2019s Supreme Court, which is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to hear a request from the Justice Ministry to outlaw the religious organization and stop its more than 170, 000 Russian members from spreading \u201cextremist\u201d texts. Extremism, as defined by a law passed in 2002 but amended and expanded several times since, has become a catchall charge that can be deployed against just about anybody, as it has been against some of those involved in recent   protests in Moscow and scores of other cities. Several students who took part in demonstrations in the Siberian city of Tomsk are now being investigated by a special   unit, while Leonid Volkov, the senior aide to the jailed protest leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he himself was detained last week under the extremism law. In the case of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the putative extremism seems to derive mostly from the group\u2019s absolute opposition to violence, a stand that infuriated Soviet and now Russian authorities whose legitimacy rests in large part on the celebration of martial triumphs, most notably over Nazi Germany in World War II but also over rebels in Syria. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, members of a denomination founded in the United States in the 19th century and active in Russia for more than 100 years, refuse military service, do not vote and view God as the only true leader. They shun the patriotic festivals promoted with gusto by the Kremlin, like the annual celebration of victory in 1945 and recent events to celebrate the annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Mr. Sivak, who says he lost his job as a physical education teacher because of his role as a Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses elder, said he voted for Mr. Putin in 2000, three years before joining the denomination. He added that while he had not voted since, nor had he supported   activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of Russia\u2019s   version of the K. G. B. the Federal Security Service, or F. S. B. \u201cI have absolutely no interest in politics,\u201d he said during a recent Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Friday service in a wooden country house in Vorokhobino, a   village north of Moscow. Around 100 worshipers crammed into a long, chilly room under fluorescent lights to listen to readings from the Bible, sing and watch a video advising them to dress for worship as they would for a meeting with the president. \u201cFrom the Russian state\u2019s perspective, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are completely separate,\u201d said Geraldine Fagan, the author of \u201cBelieving in Russia  \u2014   Religious Policy After Communism. \u201d She added, \u201cThey don\u2019t get involved in politics, but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation. \u201d \u201cThe idea of independent and public religious activity that is completely outside the control of  \u2014   and also indifferent to  \u2014   the state sets all sorts of alarm bells ringing in the Orthodox Church and the security services,\u201d she said. That the worldwide headquarters of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is in the United States and that its publications are mostly prepared there, Ms. Fagan added, \u201call adds up to a big conspiracy theory\u201d for the increasingly assertive F. S. B. For Mr. Sivak, it has added up to a long legal nightmare. His troubles began, he said, when undercover security officers posed as worshipers and secretly filmed a service where he was helping to officiate in 2010. Accused of \u201cinciting hatred and disparaging the human dignity of citizens,\u201d he was put on trial for extremism along with a second elder, Vyacheslav Stepanov, 40. The prosecutor\u2019s case, heard by a municipal court in Sergiyev Posad, a center of the Russian Orthodox Church, produced no evidence of extremism and focused instead on the insufficient patriotism of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \u201cTheir disregard for the state,\u201d a report prepared for the prosecution said, \u201cerodes any sense of civic affiliation and promotes the destruction of national and state security. \u201d In a ruling last year, the court found the two men not guilty, and their ordeal seemed over  \u2014   until Mr. Sivak tried to change money and was told that he had been placed on a list of \u201cterrorists and extremists. \u201d He and Mr. Stepanov now face new charges of extremism and are to appear before a regional court this month. \u201cThere is a big wave of repression breaking,\u201d Mr. Stepanov said. In response to written questions, the Justice Ministry in Moscow said a yearlong review of documents at the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u201cadministrative center\u201d near St. Petersburg had uncovered violations of a Russian law banning extremism. As a result, it added, the center should be \u201cliquidated,\u201d along with nearly 400 locally registered branches of the group and other structures. For the denomination\u2019s leaders in Russia, the sharp escalation in a long campaign of harassment, previously driven mostly by local officials, drew horrifying flashbacks to the Soviet era. Vasily Kalin, the chairman of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 Russian arm, recalled that his whole family had been deported to Siberia when he was a child. \u201cIt is sad and reprehensible that my children and grandchildren should be facing a similar fate,\u201d he said. \u201cNever did I expect that we would again face the threat of religious persecution in modern Russia. \u201d In Russia, as in many countries, the    proselytizing of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses often causes irritation, and their theological idiosyncrasies disturb many mainstream Christians. The group has also been widely criticized for saying that the Bible prohibits blood transfusions. But it has never promoted violent or even peaceful political resistance. \u201cI cannot imagine that anyone really thinks they are a threat,\u201d said Alexander Verkhovsky, director of the SOVA Center for Information and Analysis, which monitors extremism in Russia. \u201cBut they are seen as a good target. They are pacifists, so they cannot be radicalized, no matter what you do to them. They can be used to send a message. \u201d That message, it would seem, is that everyone needs to get with the Putin program  \u2014   or risk being branded as an extremist for displaying indifference, never mind hostility, to the Kremlin\u2019s drive to make Russia a great power again. \u201cA big reason they are being targeted is simply that they are an easy target,\u201d Ms. Fagan said. \u201cThey don\u2019t vote, so nobody is going to lose votes by attacking them. \u201d Attacking Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses also sends a signal that even the mildest deviation from the norm, if proclaimed publicly and insistently, can be punished under the   law, which was passed after Russia\u2019s second war in Chechnya and the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. Billed as a move by Russia to join a worldwide struggle against terrorism, the law prohibited \u201cincitement of racial, national or religious strife, and social hatred associated with violence or calls for violence. \u201d But the reference to violence was later deleted, opening the way for the authorities to classify as extremist any group claiming to offer a unique, true path to religious or political salvation. Even the Russian Orthodox Church has sometimes fallen afoul of the law: The slogan \u201cOrthodoxy or Death!\u201d  \u2014   a rallying cry embraced by some   believers  \u2014   has been banned as an illegal extremist text. To help protect the Orthodox Church and other established religions, Parliament passed a law in 2015 to exempt the Bible and the Quran, as well as Jewish and Buddhist scripture, from charges of extremism based on their claims to offer the only true faith. The main impetus for the current crackdown, however, appears to come from the security services, not the Orthodox Church. Roman Lunkin, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, a Moscow research group, described it as \u201cpart of a broad policy of suppressing all nongovernmental organizations\u201d that has gained particular force because of the highly centralized structure of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses under a worldwide leadership based in the United States. \u201cThey are controlled from outside Russia, and this is very suspicious for our secret services,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like having an organization that they do not and cannot control. \u201d Artyom Grigoryan, a former Jehovah\u2019s Witness who used to work at the group\u2019s Russian headquarters but who now follows the Orthodox Church, said the organization had \u201cmany positive elements,\u201d like its ban on excessive drinking, smoking and other unhealthy habits. All the same, he said it deserved to be treated with suspicion. \u201cLook at it from the view of the state,\u201d he said. \u201cHere is an organization that is run from America, that gets financing from abroad, and whose members don\u2019t serve in the army and don\u2019t vote. \u201d Estranged from his parents, who are still members and view his departure as sinful, he said Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses broke up families and \u201cin the logic of the state, it presents a threat. \u201d He added, \u201cI am not saying this is real or not, but it needs to be checked by objective experts. \u201d Mr. Sivak, now preparing for yet another trial, said that he had always tried to follow the law and that he respected the state, but could not put its interests above the commands of his faith. \u201cThey say I am a terrorist,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all I ever wanted to do was to get people to pay attention to the Bible. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Re: Why We Are Still In \u2018The Danger Zone\u2019 Until January 20th, 2017", "author": "greanfinisher .", "text": "Why We Are Still In \u2018The Danger Zone\u2019 Until January 20th, 2017   17th, 2016 \nDonald Trump is not the president yet, and Barack Obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the White House. Prior to the election, I described the period of time ending on January 20th as \u201cthe danger zone\u201d, and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. As you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). On the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trump\u2019s victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard. \nAnd the truth is that Donald Trump has not even won the presidency yet. As I detailed shortly before election night , the next president will not be determined until December 19th when the Electoral College meets. \nOn Monday, December 19th the members of the Electoral College will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president. It is then, and only then, that the next president of the United States will be elected. \nThroughout our history, electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time, but there have been \u201cfaithless electors\u201d before, and if Democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in December it is still possible (though not probable) that Hillary Clinton could win the election. \nOne petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people. The petition claims that Donald Trump is \u201cunfit to serve\u201d as president, and that since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead. The following comes from a USA Today article entitled \u201c Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump? \u201c\u2026 \nA Change.org petition, now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec. 19. The petition argues that Donald Trump is \u201cunfit to serve\u201d and that \u201cSecretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.\u201d \n\u201cIf they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win,\u201d the petition states. \u201cHowever, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine \u2013 which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states\u2019 votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.\u201d \nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe that this is going to happen. They may be able to flip a few electors, but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the Democrats to overcome. \nHowever, that is not the only concern we are facing. Ever since his victory on November 8th, there have been a multitude of violent threats against Donald Trump and his family. And without a doubt, there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep Donald Trump from getting to Inauguration Day. So let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family. \nIf Donald Trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the Electoral College vote on December 19th, Mike Pence would take his place. \nBut if something were to happen to him before December 19th, his electors would be free to vote for another candidate \u2013 including Hillary Clinton. \nIf everything goes smoothly and Donald Trump successfully makes it to Inauguration Day, he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in United States history. \nIn an article for The Most Important News , I showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon Washington D.C. on January 20th in order to disrupt the Inauguration festivities as much as possible. \nThis giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects, and they have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag \u201c#DisruptJ20\u2033 is being widely used all over social media. \nTraditionally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and celebration, but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot. \nLet us hope that they are not successful. \nAnother reason why we will be in \u201cthe danger zone\u201d over the next two months is because of what Barack Obama may choose to do at the United Nations. \nNow that it looks like Donald Trump is going to be our next president, the international pressure on Barack Obama to do something at the United Nations regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense. \nAnd this is something that Trump and his advisers are actively concerned about. In fact, I came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the Trump team is warning Obama \u201cagainst making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office\u201d \u2026 \nSaying that pushing agendas \u201ccontrary to the president-elect\u2019s position\u201d would not be in the \u201cspirit of the transition\u201d, Trump national security advisor for Donald Trump last week warned the Obama administration against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office. \n\u201cOn big, transformative issues where President Obama and President-elect Trump are not in alignment, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in keeping with the spirit of the transition\u2026to try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the president-elect\u2019s positions,\u201d the advisor told Politico . \nSpecifically, the concern is that Obama may decide to support a UN Security Council resolution that would officially recognize a Palestinian state, set the parameters for a \u201ctwo state solution\u201d, and establish East Jerusalem as the capital for the new Palestinian state. \nJust a few weeks ago, an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled \u201c Obama\u2019s Israel Surprise? \u201d reported that this is one of the options that the Obama administration is strongly considering right now. A UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians, and it would be something that President Trump would not be able to undo. \nThe rest of the UN Security Council is eager to support such a resolution, and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of Barack Obama, and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do. The following comes from an article by Leo Hohmann \u2026 \nThe Wall Street Journal reported one week before Tuesday\u2019s election that Obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nIsraeli diplomats, according to the WSJ story, are preparing for the possibility that a lame-duck President Obama \u201cmay try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations.\u201d \nThe president is presumably now reviewing those options, which number about half a dozen. \nHe may be preparing to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. before he leaves office , WSJ reported. \nIf Barack Obama decides to divide the land of Israel at the United Nations, it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency. I have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in America if it happens, and it will also mean that many of the events that I warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating. \nBut if we can get to January 20th and the land of Israel has not been divided yet, we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while, because Trump has already said that he would not support a UN Security Council resolution that forces a solution on the Israelis and Palestinians. \nWhen politicians are going to do something that they know people won\u2019t like, they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people aren\u2019t paying attention. For example, yesterday I discussed how the legislation that created the Federal Reserve was rushed through Congress right before Christmas in 1913 . \nSo keep an eye on the period around Thanksgiving and the period around Christmas. If Barack Obama is going to stab Israel in the back, it may happen during one of those times. \nMy hope is that we can get through January 20th without anything going seriously wrong. If that happens, I know that I will be very thankful. \nAnd as I detailed in a previous article , Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on January 21st, and that will happen in year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. \nCould that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe? \nOr will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation? \nI believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history, and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions. \n\u201cDanger Zone\u201d Brings back memories of Kenny Loggins and Top Gun. anonymous \nListen to her howlin\u2019 roar Metal under tension Beggin\u2019 you to touch and go Highway to the Danger Zone Ride into the Danger Zone Headin\u2019 into twilight Spreadin\u2019 out her wings tonight She got you jumpin\u2019 off the deck And shovin\u2019 into overdrive Highway to the Danger Zone I\u2019ll take you Right into the Danger Zone William Lutz \nI will not celebrate the holidays this year!

There is only one way jobs are created, and that is when there is demand for products and services.

But one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in Syria. Billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of Syria. \nIt should have a completely unremarkable US regime change operation: \n* Send in the NGOs to agitate locals * Make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower * Get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the government(after they attacked the government) * Pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage: \"Simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime!\" * Wield the tremendous economic power of the US to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the UN * Flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government * Fake chemical attacks, US intelligence agency compromised UN reports and inspectors, etc. \nAll of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of Syria. \nI think it is safe to assume the US intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish, share, or consume 'unauthorized' information from countries that are targets of regime change. \nThe easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the US intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as 'terror propaganda' and US social media and Internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources.

George Washington only had four departments in his administration as first President of the United States. \nPerhaps if Mr. Trump can't find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he \"drains the swamp\", he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified non-militarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration.

This is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may, under certain conditions, turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process.

Rule by monopolistic global corporations, at best, supports 20% of the population in the short term. It enriches the ruling elite and their servants and improvises everyone else. In the long term, climate change or a nuclear war, brought on by the blind needs of greed, will end the world as we know it.

I think at least Western Syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result. \nBut Trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future. After the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically Russia 1, US 0, he's not going to be so pliable. He sure as fuck isn't going to throw Israel under a bus. He's not going to roll over on all American commitments in the region. \nTrump's been getting a complete rundown on the big picture. It's no secret that until recently he couldn't have found Damascus on a map. Now he knows about the Shiite Crescent and how the arms can flow from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for Israel. \nNow there's action towards taking Raqqa by the Kurds and who knows who else. The US and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in. I'm surprised the Kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the US a couple of months ago They're not going all in right now as things are ongoing in Mosul and will be for a while. But you don't hear Assad and the Russians squawking much about it. It's like they both know that parts of Eastern Syria are bye-bye. \nTrump's good will towards Russia certainly doesn't extend to Iran. And no American will ever call Hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the Marine barracks truck bombing in Beirut all those years ago. If Putin and Trump are going to come to a general understanding in the ME there's going to have to be some give and take. \nPutin's done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. It's looking good for him to keep his man in power in Syria and to establish a permanent presence in the ME with Khmeimim and Tartus. Once Trump is fully up to speed on the totality of American interests in the region he is bound by his office not to walk away from them. There will have to be some serious deal-making.

Luis Gutierrez (  ) made the rounds on MSBNC and CNN, dismissing President Donald Trump\u2019s offer to help Chicago end gun violence, and blaming the NRA for the death and mayhem currently marring the Windy City. [Gutierrez was reacting to Trump\u2019s description of the \u201ccarnage\u201d in Chicago and his pledge to intervene federally if city leaders fail to stop the violence. On January 24 Trump tweeted:  If Chicago doesn\u2019t fix the horrible \u201dcarnage\u201d going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016) I will send in the Feds!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017,  The following day, Gutierrez appeared on All In With Chris Hayes and said, \u201c[President Trump] tweets about the \u201ccarnage\u201d and that he\u2019s going to send the feds in. Did he send any extra money for police officers? We could use that, for training. \u201d He noted that Trump is increasing the number of Border Patrol agents on the southern border and said Chicago would like to have more federal agents \u2014  ATF and FBI \u2014  in the city as well. Then Gutierrez said: But  \u2026    [President Trump is] with the NRA. The NRA that endorsed him, [that is]  \u2026    so part of his relationship. You know that NRA did? It crippled the laws of the city of Chicago and the courts, so that we cannot keep guns off our streets. The next day Gutierrez appeared on CNN, where he was again asked about Trump\u2019s \u201ccarnage\u201d assessment and his pledge to send in the feds if Chicago city leaders fail to end the violence. Gutierrez said: Here\u2019s the hypocrisy of it all. The fact is, Donald Trump loves the NRA. And during his campaign he embraced them and they embraced him. The city of Chicago had some of the most stringent gun control laws, how were they eviscerated? Because the NRA funded lawsuits against our gun control measures. Gutierrez ignores the fact that Chicago had some its highest annual murder rates while all the city\u2019s gun controls were place. For example, the Chicago Police Department reports 921 murders during 1991, 940 during 1992. 850 during 2993, and 930 during 1994. These excessively high murder numbers all occurred while Chicago\u2019s ban on handgun ownership was in place. Viewed in this light, the 762 murders CNN reported for 2016 were a far cry from some of the murder numbers witnessed while Chicago\u2019s most \u201cstringent gun controls\u201d were in effect.

Carroll", "text": "This article originally ran in April. We are resurfacing it in light of new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that advise giving peanuts to children early and often as a strategy to forestall an allergy.  It has become an article of faith among many women I know to eliminate some foods during pregnancy, out of concern that their children could become allergic to them: shellfish, dairy and, most of all, peanuts. After their babies arrive, they continue to abstain from certain foods while   and they certainly keep their children from eating them. But research in the last few years has consistently shown that all this avoidance often does more harm than good. In many cases, we need to be doing the opposite. Mothers didn\u2019t adopt this behavior out of nowhere. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines on reducing a child\u2019s risk for developing allergies. They recommended that mothers \u201celiminate peanuts and tree nuts (e. g. almonds, walnuts, etc.) and consider eliminating eggs, cow\u2019s milk, fish, and perhaps other foods from their diets while nursing. \u201d Further, they recommended that children at high risk for allergies be given no solid foods until six months of age, no dairy products until 1 year old, no eggs until age 2, and no peanuts, nuts or fish until age 3. A debate has been raging in the health care system for decades on this topic. I was part of a systematic review that examined the relationship between early solid food introduction and allergic disease in children. We found no good evidence to support the idea that being exposed to solid foods earlier led to persistent food allergies. To its credit, the A. A. P. changed its recommendations based on new research. In 2008, updated guidelines reported that maternal restrictions in pregnancy or   no longer seemed like advice that should be widely recommended. It also acknowledged that there didn\u2019t seem much reason to delay the introduction of \u201callergy\u201d foods like peanuts after six months, around the age babies move from milk or formula to a wider range of food. Unfortunately, this did little to change people\u2019s behavior. Many had already internalized the advice. It seemed logical to them that avoiding foods would give children less of a chance to develop allergies. If it was still a good idea not to expose children until they were six months old, why not keep going? A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year turned all of this on its head. Researchers enrolled 640 infants at high risk for allergies, between 4 and 11 months of age, in a trial and randomized them to one of two groups. One of them was to avoid peanut protein the other was to eat at least six grams of peanut protein a week given in three or more meals. All participants were followed until they were 5 years old. What was most surprising in this work was that 15 percent of the infants already had evidence of peanut sensitivity by allergy testing. They were enrolled in the trial despite this, and half of them were given peanut extract every week. The results were remarkable. At the end of the study, about 3 percent of those exposed to peanuts had developed a peanut allergy, compared with more than 17 percent among those who avoided peanuts. More surprising, if you looked just at the children who already had evidence of peanut sensitivity when they were babies, fewer than 11 percent of those regularly exposed to peanuts developed an allergy. But more than 35 percent of those who avoided peanuts developed an allergy. Children who had proven sensitivity to peanuts, but consumed them in their diet regularly, were less likely to develop a peanut allergy than children without sensitivity who avoided them. Recently,   results were published. After the trial ended, researchers asked all the participants who had been regularly consuming peanuts to avoid them for the next 12 months. At the end of that period, when the children were 6, there was no significant increase in new peanut allergies in that group. Avoidance at this point made no difference. The critical need for exposure appears to be somewhere from infancy until age 5. These results were so convincing that, once again, experts are changing their recommendations. In September 2015, the A. A. P.  \u2014   along with others  \u2014   argued that \u201chealth care providers should recommend introducing   products into the diets of \u2018 \u2019 infants early on in life. \u201d These changes dovetail nicely within what has become known as the hygiene hypothesis, the gist of which is that as we\u2019ve made our environment more and more sterile, our immune systems develop differently than they used to. Without exposure to outside things to fight, our defenses turn inward and toward more benign substances, leading to increased levels of eczema, asthma and allergies. Of course, many people used to die from infections that no longer threaten us because of advances, so no one should take this as a call for living in filth. Nor should anyone take these recent findings as advice to feed babies and small children peanuts and other foods without concern. All changes to an infant\u2019s diet, especially in children with allergies, should be done in consultation with a health care professional. As with many things in health care, however, we went too far with our response to peanut and other food allergies. Avoidance is sometimes needed for those with severe reactions. When we apply those same rules to everyone else, however, things can backfire.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "MRI Shows Detailed Images of 20-Week Unborn Babies - Breitbart", "author": "Dr. Susan Berry", "text": "A newly developed MRI scan allows parents to see detailed images of the beating heart of even a   unborn baby, as well as clear pictures of the baby stretching its legs and even swallowing in the womb. [The new scan, developed by a   team of medical researchers, could replace the somewhat grainy ultrasound images parents are more accustomed to viewing during pregnancy.  UK video parenting site ChannelMum is sharing the video, created by the iFind project, which shows an MRI scan of a baby at 20 weeks. Cathy Ranson, who edits the site, says, \u201cScans are amazing as they help mums, dads and even other family members bond with their baby. \u201d    \u201cThere is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you, and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey are truly breathtaking. \u201d According to the Daily Mail, the new scan is also revving up the abortion debate in the UK once again since, with the new technology, parents and doctors can see clearly how fully formed an unborn baby is at 20 weeks. Currently, the legal abortion limit in the UK is 24 weeks. \u201cHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously supported slashing the limit to 12 weeks and there have also been calls to reduce it to 20 weeks,\u201d says the report. With a   administration now in the White House in the United States, national leaders who oppose abortion are hoping to pass the   Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban most abortions past the   mark, into law. Dr. David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at King\u2019s College London who has participated in the project, says, \u201cTaking pictures of a 20 week fetus while they\u2019re still in the womb really isn\u2019t that easy. \u201d He explains: For one thing, they\u2019re very small. The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. Ultrasound technology  \u2014   used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK  \u2014   is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back (\u2018echo\u2019) from the structures inside the body to produce an image. The MRI scan, unlike an ultrasound, shows what is happening under the baby\u2019s skin, so that images can be obtained even of babies who move around frequently. \u201cIn fetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent, but unfortunately, that\u2019s not true for every patient,\u201d Lloyd continues. \u201cUltrasound has to be able to \u2018see\u2019 through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image, and that isn\u2019t always easy. It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors. \u201d \u201cMRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images, isn\u2019t so limited,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether there\u2019s bone, muscle or fat in the way and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound. \u201d \u201cImportantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy,\u201d Lloyd adds.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Aren\u2019t Dairy", "author": "Alexandria Laredo", "text": "  Now, numerous studies have concluded that milk doesn\u2019t actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought. A study published in the British Medical Journal , for example, followed more than 100,000 people in Sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years, with shocking results: The people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer. The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. It is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink. A lot of dairy products are filled with the hormones that were given to female cows to keep them perpetually lactating so they produce an endless flow of milk. This doctor describes it perfectly when he says \u201ccow\u2019s milk is for baby calfs, just like human milk is for babies.\u201d It is a substance we need while in crucial stages of development, but past a certain age, it becomes obsolete. While there are many alternatives to dairy milk, some are much better than others. Here are some of the better \u201cmilk\u201d products out there. Almond Milk Raw organic almond milk is a great choice when you know where it\u2019s coming from. As with many mass produced products, even some almond milks aren\u2019t the best for us. An analysis of a UK almond milk brand showed that nuts make up only 2% of the drink itself. A single serving of almond milk has almost no protein. Compared with plain old almonds, it fares even worse. There is one place where almond milk comes out on top, of course: It has more potassium and more of the vitamins A and D. But almond milk is fortified with these nutrients \u2014 they\u2019ve been added during the production process. Making almond milk yourself, however, is a fantastic option, and allows you to control exactly what goes inside it, ensuring there are no additives, preservatives, or substances you\u2019ve never even heard of before. Rice Milk Rice milk is another good choice that works well as a dairy substitute, if you don\u2019t mind the taste. It\u2019s higher in carbohydrates than other milk choices and contains around the same amount of calcium as cow\u2019s milk. Yet it contains almost no protein, so it needs to be balanced with other protein rich foods. During processing, the carbs break down into sugars and give the milk a sweet taste. It is filled with more sugar, around 10 grams for one serving, which is a lot more than something like coconut milk, which has around 3 grams. If you\u2019re trying to have as little sugar as possible, rice milk may not be the best choice, but it\u2019s certainly better than plain old dairy milk. Coconut Milk Coconut milk is definitely one of the healthier options here. When this milk is all natural, meaning there\u2019s no added sugars, natural flavours, or preservatives, it is incredibly healthy for us. \u201c Coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre, vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5 and B6 and minerals including iron, selenium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous.\u201d The things that makes coconuts so good is the type of fat they contain. They have a form of medium-chain fatty acids rather than long-chain fatty acids, which are stored in our tissue for much longer. One of the beneficial acids within coconuts is called lauric acid. This gets converted inside the body into a beneficial substance called monolaurin acid, which acts as an antiviral agent. But unlike other milks, if you have access, you can go right up to a coconut tree and drink the milk straight from the coconut without the need for processing. This is one of the most pure and fresh ways to get some milk in you! Hemp Milk Ah, hemp; one of the most versatile plants on our planet. Hemp milk has a wide range of health benefits that a lot of other milks don\u2019t. Some companies make fully organic, non-GMO, and unsweetened hemp milk, but it\u2019s always good to check exactly where you\u2019re getting your products from. Hemp milk has a more bean-like and nutty flavor to it, which still tastes great in many drinks or foods. It\u2019s also packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help with our heart health. In a single 8-ounce glass of hemp milk you can find the following nutrients: Vitamin A", "label": "1"}, {"title": "Ryan Lochte Dropped by Speedo USA and Other Retailers - The New York Times", "author": "Katie Rogers", "text": "The fallout from Ryan Lochte\u2019s story about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio  \u2014   a tale the Brazilian police said was not true  \u2014   continued Monday when four companies said they would end business partnerships with Mr. Lochte, an American swimmer and   Olympic medalist. After a week of intense international media attention and anger in Brazil, the financial repercussions were swift for Mr. Lochte as Speedo USA, the luxury clothing retailer Ralph Lauren and the mattress company Airweave all announced that they would part ways with him. And Syneron Candela, a company that sells   devices, told Reuters its relationship with the swimmer ended on Sunday. Speedo USA said in a message on Twitter that it would instead donate a $50, 000 portion of Mr. Lochte\u2019s fee to a charity to help Brazilian children. \u201cWhile we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for,\u201d the company said in its statement. On Monday, Kim Angelastro, a spokeswoman for Syneron Candela, wrote in an email, \u201cWe hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners. \u201d Mr. Lochte was a spokesman for the company\u2019s Gentle Hair Removal brand. Through a spokeswoman, Ralph Lauren said Monday that Mr. Lochte\u2019s endorsement agreement with the clothing company had been for only the 2016 Olympics, and that his contract would not be renewed. Airweave said on Twitter that \u201cafter careful consideration, we have made the decision to end our partnership with Ryan Lochte. \u201d The decisions to cut ties with Mr. Lochte, 32, were the first major signs of the financial fallout for him. For the past week, he has been at the center of an international firestorm after the Brazilian police said he and three other American athletes  \u2014   Jimmy Feigen, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz  \u2014   had fabricated the account of being robbed after a   party in Rio de Janeiro. The authorities said that the swimmers had instead drunkenly vandalized a gas station bathroom, paying a security guard about $50 for the damage before leaving. Mr. Lochte originally said that the car they were traveling in had been stopped by armed men, who held a gun to his head. But his story later changed. A Brazilian judge ordered the swimmers to remain in Rio, but Mr. Lochte had already left the country. After Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz were pulled from their flight to the United States, they told the police that the confrontation began when Lochte pulled a poster off a gas station wall. Mr. Feigen, 26, later donated $10, 800 to a charity in Rio that teaches martial arts to poor children. Mr. Lochte first issued an apology on social media  \u2014   \u201cI should have been much more responsible for how I handled myself,\u201d he wrote  \u2014   then told Matt Lauer in an interview on NBC that he had been intoxicated and that he had \u201coverexaggerated that story. \u201d He has maintained that he was held at gunpoint. \u201cAll we know is that there was a gun pointed in our direction, and we were demanded to give money,\u201d Mr. Lochte said. Mr. Lochte, whose boyish and sometimes oafish personality had made him a commercial success in Olympics past, had headed into Rio with fewer sponsors than he\u2019d had at the London Games, according to a report by CNN Money.

[\u201cDuring the Obama administration, the Division served purely ideological ends with rigidity unmatched in other federal offices. Entrenched federal bureaucrats jettisoned precepts like equal enforcement in favor of political and racialized dogmas with a zeal that risks litigation failure and invites court sanctions,\u201d the letter states.  Signed by such conservative heavyweights as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the letter paints a picture of a Division ripe for sweeping reform after eight years under Obama during which \u201cThe Civil Rights Division has relegated its leadership role to political activists. \u201d Hiring practices for the career staff of the Division is one of the letter\u2019s chief concerns. While Tom Perez, now head of the Democratic National Committee, was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, the Division was the subject of an Inspector General\u2019s review that found the Obama Justice Department\u2019s insistence that   have a \u201cdemonstrated commitment to civil rights\u201d led to a perception only   activists need apply. \u201cIn this case, perception and reality were synonymous,\u201d the letter insists, noting instances in which Division employees leaked confidential information to civil rights groups, and Perez\u2019s subsequent refusal to implement any of the report\u2019s hiring recommendations. Also among the letter\u2019s complaints is the alleged culture of politically motivated bullying that was fostered during the Obama years. The same Inspector General\u2019s Report found a pattern of personal attacks against, for example, employees who were \u201copenly Christian. \u201d J. Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and a signatory of the letter, added, \u201cFor years, a radicalized Civil Rights Division   advanced leftists causes with respect to voting, law enforcement, immigration, and others while constitutional Rule of Law was considered a nuisance. General Sessions has an opportunity to begin the course correction necessary to protect all Americans from civil rights abuses. \u201d In picking a new head for the Civil Rights Division, the letter\u2019s signatories hope Attorney General Sessions will look for a reformer prepared to return to   civil rights enforcement and tackle the Division\u2019s entrenched cultural problems. \u201cThe next AAG certainly cannot be a proponent of the status quo by any means,\u201d they say.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Internal Inquiry Sealed the Fate of Roger Ailes at Fox - The New York Times", "author": "Jim Rutenberg, Ben Protess and Emily Steel", "text": "Executives at 21st Century Fox decided to end the tenure of Roger Ailes after lawyers they hired to investigate an allegation of sexual harassment against him took statements from at least six other women who described inappropriate behavior from Mr. Ailes, two people briefed on the inquiry said Wednesday. One of the people said that the details of the allegations, while unverified, were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little choice but to force an end to Mr. Ailes\u2019s reign as chairman and chief executive of Fox News, given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture. The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr. Ailes\u2019s exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that would recognize Mr. Ailes\u2019s service to the company as the founder and leader of Fox News, which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a major profit engine for 21st Century Fox. The agreement could also include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant. But given the personalities and complications involved, the situation was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday night. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the discussions or on the investigation, which is being conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. Lawyers for Mr. Ailes did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than a dozen Fox News staff members, including some top stars, have publicly supported him. The people briefed on the investigation, who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation, stressed that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr. Ailes, and not the broader climate at the network. But Mr. Ailes\u2019s departure will have much wider implications. Given Fox News\u2019s place as a central hub for conservative opinion  \u2014   not to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump  \u2014   the shape of its   operation goes beyond corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox, and could have consequences for the national political dialogue. In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed suit against Mr. Ailes, the Murdoch family, which runs 21st Century Fox, has made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct, and that these needed to extend to Fox News, as well. The question in the   environment is to what extent the Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr. Ailes\u2019s current management team. That, in turn, could determine the future approach and look of the network, which is the outlet of choice for   viewers seeking an alternative to the mainstream media. Speculation about who Mr. Ailes\u2019s successor would be transfixed the media world on Wednesday, with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News president, David Rhodes, who had worked at Fox News for several years one of Mr. Ailes\u2019s current lieutenants, like Bill Shine or Michael Clemente the New York Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from conservative media like Christopher Ruddy, the founder and chief executive of Newsmax Media Inc. At least for the day, fears that some of Fox News\u2019s   stars, like Bill O\u2019Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, would exercise contract clauses to leave with Mr. Ailes\u2019s loss of his chairmanship, appeared to abate. Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn Kelly, who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network. She was one of the women who told Paul, Weiss investigators that Mr. Ailes had acted improperly with her, one of the people briefed on the inquiry said Tuesday. Ms. Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday. But as the end of Mr. Ailes\u2019s chairmanship approached, it appeared to embolden other women to discuss their own experiences at the network. Several spoke with reporters on condition that they not be named. In interviews, several current and former Fox News employees said inappropriate comments about a woman\u2019s appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom. The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms. Carlson filed her suit, one person said. Everybody wants to talk about the drama but nobody wants to talk in the open, the person said. As of Wednesday evening, staff members had not received an email from 21st Century Fox, Fox News or Mr. Ailes informing them about the events that have transpired, the investigation or the future of the network. The swift pace of events at Fox News  \u2014   only two weeks passed between Ms. Carlson\u2019s filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr. Ailes\u2019s leadership  \u2014   were especially surprising for a network that has made its name by embracing \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d themes, something in keeping with the brash personalities of both Mr. Ailes and the 21st Century Fox patriarch, Rupert Murdoch. Female hosts in skirts, sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs, have always been a network trademark. To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network. And 21st Century Fox\u2019s leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has so carefully cultivated, and which is central to the financial and ratings success of the network. Mr. Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close consultation  \u2014   and perhaps even some deference  \u2014   to the two sons he is grooming to succeed him, Lachlan and James Murdoch. The latter, at least, is known to have different politics from his father. So far, none of the three has made any public statement about the network, its future or, for that matter, Mr. Ailes.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Press TV Debate: Duff on Lebanon, Hezbollah and Aoun\u2019s Presidency (3 videos)", "author": "Gordon Duff, Senior Editor", "text": "By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 2, 2016 Understanding Lebanon and the political realignment there critical to US understanding of the region...and to our future with Israel \nLebanon has a new president. The political development puts an end to over two years of power vacuum in the country. On Monday, lawmakers voted to pick General Michel Aoun as Lebanon\u2019s 13th president. The election is seen as a victory for the resistance movement Hezbollah, especially after Saad Hariri, the leader of the March 14 Alliance and a close ally of Saudi Arabia, voiced his support for Aoun. On this edition of \u2018The Debate,\u2019 Press TV has asked two analysts why they believe Hariri threw his weight behind Aoun. \nNabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, praised Hariri\u2019s measure, adding that with this decision, he actually wanted to bring stability back to Lebanon and thus avoid Syria\u2019s spillover effects. \nHariri is a shrewd politician who represents an important segment of the Lebanese society, Mikhail said, adding that by his vote for General Aoun, he aimed to take the country out of the current political deadlock and, ultimately, save it from the repercussions of the Syrian war. \nMikhail believes that the United States\u2019 shrinking power in the Middle East has forced Hariri to face away from Washington. \n\u201cI believe that Saad Hariri could have been motivated, along with others, about a vision that America\u2019s role in the Middle East is receding. So, perhaps Russia is the new reality in the Middle East, is a new power. So, anything that is somehow close to Russia will be better for Lebanon,\u201d Mikhail argued. \nMikhail said that \u201cso many things have transpired inside Lebanon and inside the Arab region within this year. I would assume that the Syrian civil war and its severity and brutality has convinced him that he can maintain good ties with the [Persian] Gulf states but at the same time study the strategic realities.\u201d \n\u201cHe (Hariri) sees that Syria has to be stable in order for Lebanon to be stable. So, he is making calculations. I hope none of them is a miscalculation because the area cannot afford any other catastrophe. So, he displayed again very well maintaining some sort of balance between his Syrian interests and [Persian] Gulf interests and perhaps he can formulate some equilibrium about this.\u201d The image grab shows Gordon Duff (L), a senior editor of Veterans Today based in Ohio, and Nabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, at Press TV\u2019s \u2018The Debate\u2019 show on Monday night. \nMeanwhile, the other guest on the show, Gordon Duff, the editor of Veterans Today , noted that, in his view, the reason behind Hezbollah\u2019s victory in Michel Aoun\u2019s election is the movement\u2019s victories in Syria, especially in Aleppo, which has made it more powerful than ever and has paved the way for domestic victories. \n\u201cIf Aleppo falls, and Aleppo will fall, it\u2019s only a matter of how long, a victorious and highly-disciplined, highly-trained Hezbollah force, [which is] heavily trained by Russia and by Iran, is going to return to Lebanon. It\u2019s a very different force and I believe Hariri is looking at this. Reaching out for what should be a very different Hezbollah could lead to stabilization of the political process in Lebanon that has been out of control,\u201d Duff reiterated.

Chen", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO  \u2014   Dogged by combustible smartphones and recalls of other devices, Samsung Electronics is hoping to find a path to product redemption. The South Korean company on Wednesday introduced the Galaxy S8, its first major smartphone release since the scandal over its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were discontinued last year after some of the devices spontaneously caught fire. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenging year for Samsung,\u201d said D. J. Koh, the company\u2019s head of mobile devices, adding that Samsung was ready to start anew. The Galaxy S8 features a large 5.  screen without adding bulk to the device. The company said it made room for the screen by reducing the size of the bezel  \u2014   or the forehead and the chin  \u2014   on the face of the device. Samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display. With the Galaxy S8, Samsung also rolled out its virtual assistant, Bixby, to rival Apple\u2019s Siri, Google\u2019s Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. Similar to previous virtual assistants, Bixby responds to voice commands. Time  \u2014   and sales  \u2014   will tell whether the Galaxy S8 will restore confidence in Samsung\u2019s smartphones. Last year, after the company received dozens of complaints about the Galaxy Note 7 overheating, and in some cases exploding, the company recalled the phones. But replacement phones continued to catch fire, and the company had to recall the devices a second time before killing the product altogether, sacrificing billions of dollars in revenue. The Galaxy Note 7 may still make a reappearance. On Monday, Samsung said that it might sell refurbished versions of the phone. Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research, said the Galaxy S8 could help Samsung recover as long as the product worked reliably. \u201cNote 7 definitely did some damage to the Samsung brand, especially for people who had little or no personal experience with Samsung devices,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as the S8 does well and doesn\u2019t suffer from any of the same problems, the memories of the Note 7 issues will fade and Samsung will recover well.\u201d Samsung last year also issued a separate recall for 2. 8 million washing machines in the United States. The machines were prone to detaching from the washing machine chassis, posing a risk of injury.

[Describing the question of whether Poland should be forced to accept a quota of migrants from the third world as \u201cof vital importance\u201d for its future security, Andrzej Duda said the referendum could be held during parliamentary elections in 2019.  \u201cThat would allow the new government to hear the clear voice of the nation on the issue,\u201d said the president. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government\u2019s position on the quota system is \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d Duda said. He said maintaining the party \u201cdoes not agree with the [plan] and asserted that \u201cPoland does not consent to the forced relocation of refugees on our territory\u201d. Holding a referendum will also enable the public\u2019s voice to be heard over the voices of international organisations, Duda asserted. \u201cIf Brussels continues to raise [the issue of migration] attempting to exert pressure and force on the Polish authorities, then public opinion will be extremely important,\u201d Duda promised. Poland\u2019s latest display of opposition to the redistribution plan comes as the Czech Republic announced its withdrawal from the scheme, which has been fiercely contested in Central and Eastern Europe, with Hungary and Slovakia challenging the plans in court.

Whether that is done through eating healthier foods, beginning a yoga or meditation practice, or whether it is done by being more mindful with the words they choose to use when having an inner dialogue or a conversation with friends and family, more people are looking for information to help them transform their lives in a positive way. While there are many methods to improving one\u2019s life, below are some methods that can help a person spark an inner revolution to create positive and uplifting change in his or her world. Grounding/Earthing Grounding, or what is also called Earthing is when a person has bare skin touching the Earth or a tree and is most commonly done by standing on the Earth with one\u2019s bare feet. Doing this begins to balance the electrochemical state of the body because of the negative ions the Earth emits. Negative ions act as antioxidants (free-radical scavengers) by pairing up with the free radicals and rendering them neutral. Thus, pain, inflammation and anything out of balance begins to move towards balance, or homeostasis. There have been several studies that have shown how grounding helps with pain reduction, wounding healing, balancing of the circadian rhythm to help improve sleep, as well as helping to shift a person\u2019s brainwaves to the alpha state, which is great for a calm and balanced, yet alert and fully awake state of mind. Standing barefoot on the Earth, sand, dirt or concrete (not asphalt) will allow the free flow of negative ions to come in contact with the sensory neurons on the skin and begin to trigger positive physiological and psychological changes within the body. Taking it a bit further, if a person is able to connect with the Earth in a quiet place, the benefits could be even more as Dr. Joe Dispenza has said , \u201cIn clinical studies, we have proven that 2 hours of nature sounds a day significantly reduce stress hormones up to 800% and activates 500-600 DNA segments known to be responsible for healing and repairing the body.\u201d Burning Sage In a 2007 study from the Journal of Ethnopharmacology , researchers found that medicinal smoke killed harmful airborne bacteria by up to 94% in just one hour. On a more spiritual level, burning sage has long been used to clear negative or disharmonious energies from a space. This can be done when a person comes home from work or school for that day, as burning sage can be a good way to clear any discordant energy the person may have \u201cpicked up\u201d or had \u201ctaken on\u201d from other people or their environment. It is used to clear away such energy so that a person can be centered in who he or she is, rather than having to deal with issues that might have been taken on from others. I personally do this each time after coming home from getting groceries or running and errand. Essential Oils The two best ways to use essential oils are to smell them as well as apply them to the skin. While applying essential oils to the skin has many of it\u2019s own benefits, smelling them also creates wonderful responses in the body, and especially the brain. According to the University of Minnesota , smelling essential oils\u2019 molecules affect the olfactory organs, the lungs (and thus the respiratory system) as well as the brain. Odor molecules travel through the nose and positively affect the limbic system of the brain, which is sometimes called the \u201cemotional part of the brain.\u201d To this end, the limbic system controls heart rate, mood, blood pressure, memory, breathing, stress hormone response and overall stress levels. Applying or smelling essential oils throughout the day is a wonderful way to develop emotional intelligence and can help a person respond to stressful situations in a more positive way than before. Smelling essential oils can be personally described as an uplifting and heavenly experience; one that allows us to smell the cosmic byproduct of thousands of flowers pressed into a wonderful gift for humanity. Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises, which can also be considered a form of meditation, can have profound effects on the body and mind. According to Deepok Chopra , a regular practice of rhythmic deep breathing has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, stabilize blood pressure, increase energy levels and decrease feelings of stress. Over time, a breathing or meditation practice can lead to wonderful internal shifts both physically and emotionally. Incorporating a deep breathing practice into the practice of grounding or Earthing is a great way to accomplish both practices at once. Here is an article of three sample breathing exercises from Dr. Andrew Weil. While there are many other practices a person can use to help catalyze deeper inner growth, such as flower essence therapy (different from essential oils), nature walking, sun-bathing and the use of certain health supplements like fulvic acid and Reishi , this list is a guide that may help those who may just be starting to experience an internal transformation. These four simple practices can be easy to incorporate into one\u2019s life and is recommended to experiment with what feels best for that person. What of these practices do you use in your life? What other practices do you use to help you continue your inner revolution? Share with us your practices or suggestions you have in the comments section. Cheers to our health!

Are you going to wither away in frustration, anger and despair or are you going to make choices that help you to become the best person you can be? On the opposite side, are you going to sit back and believe your personal challenges are going to be fixed with a new president or are you also going to take action to become the best person you can be? Regardless of who you did or didn\u2019t support, we all need to reclaim our personal power and continue the trek towards bettering and healing ourselves, even if it is in the smallest of ways. \nCollective Healing \nOn a wider scale, this election will give us the collective choice to where we wish to travel. Do we wish to seek peace with other people and other countries? Do we wish to have dialogue with nations previous administrations demonized? Do we wish to communicate with and try to understand other people\u2019s viewpoints or are we going to remain closed off to such opportunities for personal and collective healing and growth? \nAdditionally, are we going to continue to allow group-think to dominate our society by letting the media tell us what to believe, or are we going to begin gathering information from several sources to arrive at our own conclusions? Are we going to question our leaders more and demand answers that are truthful and unbiased towards any specific agenda? Will we do this both on a local and mass level? Are we going to work towards cooperation or continue to live in a dying paradigm of competition? \nAs physicist and author Gregg Braden says , \u201cA growing body of scientific evidence, gathered from more than 400 peer-reviewed studies, is leading to an undeniable truth: violent competition and war directly contradict our deepest instincts of cooperation and nurturing. Scientific studies show conclusively that nature is based upon a model of cooperation and mutual aid, not violent competition and war. We live in a world where everything is connected. We can no longer think in terms of us and them when it comes to the consequences of the way we live. Today it\u2019s all about WE .\u201d Science has disproved Darwin\u2019s theory and shows us we must act in unison to transcend our collective challenges. \nI see this election as many other do: a massive turning point in our world\u2019s evolution. I personally have full trust that we will look back at this time and see this as a positive, yet challenging event in that it empowered more people to begin taking action to create the kind of world they wish to live in. This turning point is allowing us all to shift our perception of the world and to initiate action towards creating a more peaceful, happy and abundant world for all. \nLance Schuttler graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in Health Science and practices health coaching through his website Orgonlight Health .

Islam", "text": "1 Shares\n1 0 0 0\nBook Review \u2013 Dr. Rafiq Islam, Emertec R&D Ltd; Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n Book title: True Islam, Jihad, and Terrorism: The Science of Islamic Foreign Policy \u2013 Jaan S. Islam\n Publisher: New York: Nova Science Publishers\n ISBN 978-1-63485-542-6.\n At a time of politics of fear, Jaan Islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece, True Islam, Jihad and Terrorism (Nova Science Publishers, New York, 2016). During the 2016 US election, it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of Islam and how it is understood in today\u2019s context. This is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about Islamic history, philosophy, and political science. This book presents the Islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great Muslim thinkers and scholars such as Ibn Khaldun. Jaan Islam uses the so-called \u2018Islamic cognition technique\u2019 and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to Islamic cognition. This chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields. Such an extension was first pointed by Islam, Zatzman and Islam (2013) in their ground-breaking work on educational curriculum.\nMORE... Stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of Modern Imperialism Another Ramadan for Muslims amid sufferings A conversation on equality, integration and Islam as a religious marker An open letter to young Muslims everywhere: The seed of triumph in every adversity Following the tradition of early Islamic scholars, Jaan Islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary Islamic sources, Qur'an and authenticated traditions of the prophet . These sources were completely ignored in the in the Orientalist (now it has morphed into neo-Orientalism) writings, which led to the inundation of the post 9/11 world with disinformation and agenda-driven \u2018research\u2019 about Islamic history. The distinction between this book and these agenda-driven ones gives the book a special value.\n Although the book explains the Islamic foundations of political science and governance, it should not be looked at as a book of theology. It is a dogma-free approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere . Quite appropriately, the author starts off with a brilliant narration of Islamic cognition. It has been all but forgotten in the west that Islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogma-free, truly scientific cognition. The west does recognize Averr\u00f6es, the famous Islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy, whereas brands Islam as just another religion, similar to Christianity, infected with doctrinal philosophy. It is no surprise that with that starting point, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west.\nChapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers, namely Hobbes, Locke and Ibn Khaldun. In this chapter, the author debunks another myth, that is Ibn Khaldun\u2019s political theory is somehow similar to those of Hobbes and Locke. Ibn Khaldun, the father of social science, indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition. The author points out how Ibn Khaldun\u2019s first premise was Shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using Qur\u2019an as the origin and prophet Muhammad\u2019s life (through the book of Hadith) as the pivotal point. One the other hand, Locke had placed himself as the pivotal point, whereas Hobbes eliminated any cognition point. The author makes it clear that both Hobbes\u2019 and Locke\u2019s cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition. In my researched opinion, this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic. It is because the eastern authors do not know about Hobbes and Locke and the western authors do not know about Islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with Ibn Khaldun.\nIn Chapter 4, the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs (known as Rashedun Caliphs). Clearly, the author\u2019s intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the Qur\u2019an they were enacting. For the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly, the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the Qur\u2019an. No other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in. This finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young Islamic state of the time.\nSimilar to Chapter 4, the author discovers jus ad bello in Islamic jurisprudence in Chapter 5. Once again, the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner, one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not. The theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter.\nIn Chapter 6, the author addresses a difficult topic. When is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state? It is often stated that Islam is a complete code of life. The author makes it clear that Islam didn\u2019t leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time. The important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary. This is not an easy topic to cover even in today\u2019s world. The author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary. The history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided Caliphate, the victors were no longer rightly guided. The author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership. This chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of Islam that has spent lifetime on the topic.\nOften when Islamic criteria are discussed, eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief. If it is all that simple, why don\u2019t Islamic scholars have consensus? The author handles this topic like a pro. In Chapter 7, he analyzes current Islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process. He has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the self-righteous, apologist \u2018scholars\u2019 that have done great disservice to Islam and/or scientific cognition process. One doesn\u2019t have to be personal, but the writing is so clear, one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars. To anyone\u2019s surprise, this list is not made out of anti-Islamic non-Muslim scholars.\nChapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears. The author analyzes every major event of today\u2019s political arena and analyzes it with the Islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum. The author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups. Most interesting is the discussion on current US allies, such as Saudi Arabia, and how they rank among the biggest offenders of Islam and Islamic laws. This is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable, punctuated with numerous riveting arguments.\nChapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation. I have studied Islam for some 30 years and yet I found these conclusions novel and entirely logical. I doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion. It is important to read the book in sequence.\nChapter 10 lists the bibliography and references. It is many pages long and is quite comprehensive.\nChapter 11 is the Appendix that lists the letters of the prophet. It is a great idea to give the letters in original Arabic, so there is no room for misinterpretation, let alone disinformation.\nAnyone with knowledge of Islam knows that Jihad is in the core of Islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology. Quite interestingly, the author even depicts Jihad as the roof of Islam. Without the roof, the Fort of Islam has no protection whatsoever. This depiction captures the essence of protection, security, as well as integrity and puts away the notion of Jihad being a weapon for Crusade like aggression.\nThis book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about Islam or what Islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word, Islam that means peace through submission to the creator. This book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in today\u2019s world. In this sense, this book is a manual for world governance in peace.", "label": "1"}, {"title": "If Donald Trump Wins The Election, It Will Be The Biggest Miracle In US Political History", "author": "The Doc", "text": "If Donald Trump Wins The Election, It Will Be The Biggest Miracle In US Political History Posted on Home \u00bb Headlines \u00bb World News \u00bb If Donald Trump Wins The Election, It Will Be The Biggest Miracle In US Political History \nAre we about to see the largest election day miracle of all time? \n\nFrom Michael Snyder : \nBecause as I will show in this article, that is precisely what it is going to take in order for Donald Trump to win. Before I go any further, I want to make it exceedingly clear that I am not saying what the outcome will be on November 8th. As I recently told a national television audience, I do not know who is going to win. \nIn this article I am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand. But in this bizarre election things can literally change overnight, and it is entirely possible that we could still have another \u201cOctober surprise\u201d or two before it is all said and done. And without a doubt Donald Trump desperately needs something \u201cto move the needle\u201d, because if the election was held today Hillary Clinton would almost certainly win. \nWhat we have witnessed so far during the 2016 election season has been absolutely unprecedented. Just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time. \nWe have never had a bigger \u201cOctober surprise\u201d than the release of the lewd audio tape from 11 years ago in which Donald Trump claimed to grope women without their consent. \nWe have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked Donald Trump. In the past, the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and balanced, but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity. \nThey should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves, and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back. \nWe have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election. It has been said that a house divided against itself will surely fall, and a whole host of prominent Republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the Trump campaign. \nIf Donald Trump is able to overcome all of these factors, it truly will be a miracle of Biblical proportions. \nAs it stands at the moment, however, the numbers are looking quite ominous for Trump. Right now, the Real Clear Politics average of national polls has Hillary Clinton ahead by 6.2 percent. Most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game. \nBut even if Trump can close that gap and pull ahead, that does not mean that he will win the election. In fact, Trump could beat Clinton by millions of votes nationally and still lose. \nIn order to win the election, one candidate has got to get to 270 electoral votes. And on the latest Real Clear Politics electoral map, 262 electoral votes are being projected to go to Hillary Clinton, 164 electoral votes are being projected to go to Donald Trump, and 112 electoral votes are in the \u201ctoss up\u201d category. \nSo unless something dramatically changes, Donald Trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to win, and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim. \nLet\u2019s take a closer look at this. The first thing that Donald Trump is going to have to do in order to get to 270 electoral votes is to win all of the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012. That would get him up to 206 electoral votes. \nUnfortunately, it looks like that may be very difficult to do. Romney won North Carolina, but the six most recent polls all have Clinton ahead in that state. Romney also won Arizona, but the most recent poll to be taken there has Clinton ahead by five points. \nBut for a moment, let\u2019s assume that Trump can win all of the states that Romney won. On top of that, there are four other states that Trump must win\u2026 \n#1 Trump must win Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes. Without Florida, Trump has no realistic path to 270 electoral votes. So on election night if it is announced that Trump has lost Florida, you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because Trump is going to lose the election. \nUnfortunately for Trump, four recent major surveys all show Trump down by four points in the Sunshine state. \n#2 Trump must win Ohio\u2019s 18 electoral votes. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, and the two most recent major surveys show that Trump and Clinton are tied in the state. \n#3 Trump must win Iowa\u2019s 6 electoral votes. Fortunately for Trump, most recent surveys show him actually leading in Iowa. \n#4 Trump must win Nevada\u2019s 6 electoral votes. At this point that is looking like it will be very tough to do, because all of the recent polls have Clinton leading in Nevada, including the most recent one that has her up by 7 points. \nIf Donald Trump can win those four states, that still does not get him to 270 electoral votes. Instead, it gets him to 265 electoral votes, and so he would still need one more medium-sized state to win. \nThe most likely candidates for that last state are Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota. Unfortunately for Trump, Clinton appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment. \nBut even if Trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the 270 electoral vote mark, the truth is that Utah could still mess everything up. \nDo you remember Evan McMullin? \nHe was the third party \u201cconservative alternative\u201d candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards. \nHe is only on the ballot in 12 states, but one of those states is Utah, and it turns out that Evan McMullin is a Mormon. \nMany Mormons believe that a Mormon will be elected president someday when the U.S. Constitution hangs \u201clike a thread\u201c. According to this belief, this Mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen. Many Mormons thought that Mitt Romney was going to be this president, but now Evan McMullin has become the target of these expectations. \nSo how in the world could Evan McMullin become president? \nWell, their plan is to have Evan McMullin win Utah, and that could potentially keep both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close. If that happens, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives. \nIt is being projected that the House will still be controlled by the Republicans after this election, and so the choice would come down to either Trump or McMullin, and those backing McMullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario. \nI know all of this sounds very strange, but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over Utah tonight. \nAnd in recent days Evan McMullin has been soaring in Utah. One recent survey shows Trump with a one point lead over McMullin, and another recent survey actually show McMullin leading Trump by four points in the state. \nSo Trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes, and Utah could end up messing up everything for him. \nIn addition, it is also very important to keep in mind that Trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud. There was widespread evidence of \u201cfunny business\u201d in 2012, and this is something that I detailed for a live studio audience down at Morningsideearlier this month\u2026 \nAre you starting to see why I would consider this to be the biggest miracle in American political history if Donald Trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election? \nAnd we don\u2019t have to wait until November 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go. Early voting is already taking place is some states, and so far the signs are not encouraging for the Trump campaign. The following comes from CNN\u2026 \nDemocratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012, while Republicans have dropped by about 14,500. In Nevada, Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots. \nPerhaps most surprisingly, Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormon-heavy Utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. At this point in 2012, Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. But so far this year, the GOP advantage is only 3,509. \nBut if you do want Trump to win, the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before November 8th. \nWe have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election, and a miracle is definitely not out of the question. \nIn fact, I am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early November. So hold on to your hats, because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us.", "label": "1"}, {"title": "Mindful Eating as Way to Fight Bingeing - The New York Times", "author": "Jeff Gordinier", "text": "Editors\u2019 note: We\u2019re resurfacing this 2012 article for Smarter Living. Now sit down, take a deep breath and really savor that Christmas cookie. TRY this: place a forkful of food in your mouth. It doesn\u2019t matter what the food is, but make it something you love  \u2014   let\u2019s say it\u2019s that first nibble from three hot, fragrant, perfectly cooked ravioli. Now comes the hard part. Put the fork down. This could be a lot more challenging than you imagine, because that first bite was very good and another immediately beckons. You\u2019re hungry. Today\u2019s experiment in eating, however, involves becoming aware of that reflexive urge to plow through your meal like Cookie Monster on a shortbread bender. Resist it. Leave the fork on the table. Chew slowly. Stop talking. Tune in to the texture of the pasta, the flavor of the cheese, the bright color of the sauce in the bowl, the aroma of the rising steam. Continue this way throughout the course of a meal, and you\u2019ll experience the    pleasures and frustrations of a practice known as mindful eating. The concept has roots in Buddhist teachings. Just as there are forms of meditation that involve sitting, breathing, standing and walking, many Buddhist teachers encourage their students to meditate with food, expanding consciousness by paying close attention to the sensation and purpose of each morsel. In one common exercise, a student is given three raisins, or a tangerine, to spend 10 or 20 minutes gazing at, musing on, holding and patiently masticating. Lately, though, such experiments of the mouth and mind have begun to seep into a secular arena, from the Harvard School of Public Health to the California campus of Google. In the eyes of some experts, what seems like the simplest of acts  \u2014   eating slowly and genuinely relishing each bite  \u2014   could be the remedy for a   Paula Deen Nation in which an endless parade of new diets never seems to slow a stampede toward obesity. Mindful eating is not a diet, or about giving up anything at all. It\u2019s about experiencing food more intensely  \u2014   especially the pleasure of it. You can eat a cheeseburger mindfully, if you wish. You might enjoy it a lot more. Or you might decide, halfway through, that your body has had enough. Or that it really needs some salad. \u201cThis is \u201d said Dr. Jan Chozen Bays, a pediatrician and meditation teacher in Oregon and the author of \u201cMindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food. \u201d \u201cI think the fundamental problem is that we go unconscious when we eat. \u201d The last few years have brought a spate of books, blogs and videos about   eating. A Harvard nutritionist, Dr. Lilian Cheung, has devoted herself to studying its benefits, and is passionately encouraging corporations and health care providers to try it. At the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, Prof. Brian Wansink, the author of \u201cMindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think,\u201d has conducted scores of experiments on the psychological factors that lead to our bottomless bingeing. A mindful lunch hour recently became part of the schedule at Google, and   gurus like Oprah Winfrey and Kathy Freston have become cheerleaders for the practice. With the annual   of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Super Bowl Sunday behind us, and Lent coming, it\u2019s worth pondering whether mindful eating is something that the mainstream ought to be, well, more mindful of. Could a discipline pioneered by Buddhist monks and nuns help teach us how to get healthy, relieve stress and shed many of the neuroses that we\u2019ve come to associate with food? Dr. Cheung is convinced that it can. Last week, she met with team members at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and asked them to spend quality time with a   almond. \u201cThe rhythm of life is becoming faster and faster, so we really don\u2019t have the same awareness and the same ability to check into ourselves,\u201d said Dr. Cheung, who, with the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh,   \u201cSavor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why mindful eating is becoming more important. We need to be coming back to ourselves and saying: \u2018Does my body need this? Why am I eating this? Is it just because I\u2019m so sad and stressed out?\u2019 \u201d The topic has even found its way into culinary circles that tend to be more focused on Rabelaisian excess than monastic restraint. In January, Dr. Michael Finkelstein, a holistic physician who oversees SunRaven, a   center in Bedford, N. Y. gave a talk about mindful gardening and eating at the   headquarters of the James Beard Foundation in New York City. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t what are the foods to eat, in my mind,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cMost people have a general sense of what the healthy foods are, but they\u2019re not eating them. What\u2019s on your mind when you\u2019re eating: that\u2019s mindful eating to me. \u201d A good place to try it is the Blue Cliff Monastery, in Pine Bush, N. Y. a Hudson Valley hamlet. At the serene refuge about 75 miles northwest of Manhattan, curious lay people can join Buddhist brothers and sisters for a free \u201cday of mindfulness\u201d twice a week. At a gathering in January, visitors watched a videotaped lecture by Thich Nhat Hanh (pronounced   ) who founded this and other monasteries around the world they strolled methodically around the grounds as part of a walking meditation, then filed into a dining room for lunch. No one spoke, in keeping with a key principle of mindful eating. The point is simply to eat, as opposed to eating and talking, eating and watching TV, or eating and watching TV and gossiping on the phone while Tweeting and updating one\u2019s Facebook status. A long buffet table of food awaited, all of it vegan and mindfully prepared by two monks in the kitchen. There was plenty of rice, herbed chickpeas, a soup made with cubes of taro, a stew of fried tofu in tomato sauce. In silence, people piled their plates with food, added a squirt or two of condiments (eating mindfully doesn\u2019t mean forsaking the hot sauce) and sat down together with eyes closed during a Buddhist prayer for gratitude and moderation. What followed was captivating and mysterious. Surrounded by a murmur of clinking forks, spoons and chopsticks, the Blue Cliff congregation, or sangha, spent the lunch hour contemplating the enjoyment of spice, crunch, saltiness, warmth, tenderness and   company. Some were thinking, too, about the origins of the food: the thousands of farmers, truck drivers and laborers whose work had brought it here. As their jaws moved slowly, their faces took on expressions of deep focus. Every now and then came a pause within the pause: A chime would sound, and, according to the monastery\u2019s custom, all would stop moving and chewing in order to breathe and explore an even deeper level of sensory awareness. It looked peaceful, but inside some of those heads, a struggle was afoot. \u201cIt\u2019s much more challenging than we would imagine,\u201d said Carolyn Cronin, 64, who lives near the monastery and regularly attends the mindfulness days. \u201cPeople are used to eating so fast. This is a practice of stopping, and we don\u2019t realize how much we\u2019re not stopping. \u201d For many people, eating fast means eating more. Mindful eating is meant to nudge us beyond what we\u2019re craving so that we wake up to why we\u2019re craving it and what factors might be stoking the habit of  . \u201cAs we practice this regularly, we become aware that we don\u2019t need to eat as much,\u201d said Phap Khoi, 43, a robed monk who has been stationed at Blue Cliff since it opened in 2007. \u201cWhereas when people just gulp down food, they can eat a lot and not feel full. \u201d It\u2019s this byproduct of mindful eating  \u2014   its potential as a psychological barrier to overeating  \u2014   that has generated excitement among nutritionists like Dr. Cheung. \u201cThich Nhat Hanh often talks about our craving being like a crying baby who is trying to draw our attention,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the baby cries, the mother cradles the baby to try to calm the baby right away. By acknowledging and embracing our cravings through a few breaths, we can stop our autopilot of reaching out to the pint of ice cream or the bag of chips. \u201d The average American doesn\u2019t have the luxury of ruminating on the intense tang of sriracha sauce at a monastery. \u201cMost of us are not going to be Buddhist monks,\u201d said Dr. Finkelstein, the holistic physician. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is that it has to work at home. \u201d To that end, he and others suggest that people start with a few baby steps. \u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself,\u201d Dr. Cheung said. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be able to switch on your mindfulness button and be able to do it 100 percent. It\u2019s a practice you keep working toward. \u201d Dr. Bays, the pediatrician, has recommendations that can sound like a return to the simple rhythms of Mayberry, if not \u201cLittle House on the Prairie. \u201d If it\u2019s impossible to eat mindfully every day, consider planning one special repast a week. Click off the TV.

If there\u2019s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon, it is that. The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money, as a percentage of the overall economy, than most of them. It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates. Now, the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived. With the House, Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority, some kind of change appears likely to happen. And it may turn out to be a very big deal, particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation. Among Washington\u2019s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd, it\u2019s known as a \u201c  cash flow tax with border adjustment. \u201d It\u2019s easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago. And it could, if enacted, have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart. This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care, or even over individual income taxes. But the consequences for business  \u2014   and for the   trajectory of the economy  \u2014   are huge. The basic idea behind a D. B. C. F. T. (to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter) is this: Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States. But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden, and those tricks distort the economy. Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a company\u2019s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes. Moreover, because interest payments on debt are   the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible, even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along. The House Republicans\u2019 approach, instead of taxing the    corporate income, goes after a firm\u2019s domestic cash flow: money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth. There\u2019s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because you\u2019ll be taxed on things you sell in the United States, regardless. \u201cWith an income tax, one of the key issues is \u2018how do you measure income,\u2019 \u201d said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a leading advocate of the idea. \u201cBut with cash flow you just follow the money. \u201d And the tax, Mr. Auerbach argues, could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt. It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time. And it doesn\u2019t give favorable treatment to debt, as opposed to equity. That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system. Congressional staff members, the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal: how it might be phased in, and how to treat financial services, and much more. Some of the most complex, and politically problematic, elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade, which creates winners and losers. And some of those potential losers are powerful. Consider what border adjustment means: When an American company exports goods under this new tax system, it would not pay any taxes on its international sales, while its imports would be taxed. So a company that spent $80 making something that it sold overseas for $100 would pay no tax on its earnings. A company that imported goods worth $80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for $100 would pay tax on the full $100. At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this. Many economists think it won\u2019t work that way, however. That\u2019s because as soon as a    tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law, the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets. And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent     effects of the tax. The dollar could rise by, say, 20 to 25 percent, and the trade balance could remain about where it started. Essentially, moving to this system means betting on a \u201ctextbook economic theory,\u201d as analysts at Evercore ISI put it, becoming a reality even though the effect hasn\u2019t been tested in practice. If the dollar doesn\u2019t strengthen as expected, for example,   industries, especially those with lean profit margins, could face disaster. That helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry. Essentially, economists are telling them \u201ctrust us, our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash,\u201d but if the models are wrong, for companies like Walmart, Target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods, their viability could be threatened. If the models turn out to be right, there is a different set of risks. The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system, and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects. Many companies worldwide, especially banks and especially in emerging markets, have debt denominated in dollars, which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation. A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States. As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted, we don\u2019t really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be. It could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on, like clothing and gasoline. That would be bad news for poorer Americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient. There\u2019s still a lot of work to be done to understand the   consequences of the D. B. C. F. T. (also, work to be done to find a catchier name). But there\u2019s a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform. The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly. No matter the outcome, 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system  \u2014   with   economic consequences  \u2014   will be up for grabs.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "I wonder what GLP will be like the day after the election?", "author": "Anonymous Coward (UID 12781064)", "text": "I wonder what GLP will be like the day after the election?

Molecular machines, the world\u2019s smallest mechanical devices, may eventually be used to create new materials, sensors and energy storage systems, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the prize. \u201cIn terms of development, the molecular motor is at the same stage as the electric motor was in the 1830s, when scientists displayed various spinning cranks and wheels, unaware that they would lead to electric trains, washing machines, fans and food processors,\u201d the academy said. The three scientists  \u2014     Sauvage, J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa  \u2014   will share equally in the prize of 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $930, 000. Nanotechnology  \u2014   the creation of structures on the scale of a nanometer, or a billionth of a meter  \u2014   has been a field of fruitful research for a couple of decades. Now, scientists are learning how to construct tiny moving machines about   the width of a strand of human hair. \u201cThey\u2019ve got it started,\u201d said Donna J. Nelson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Oklahoma and president of the American Chemical Society. \u201cThis is just the beginning. \u201d The first step toward creating a molecular machine was making a moving part. Chemists have long been able to synthesize   molecules, and they knew that interlocking rings might function as molecular parts. But how to create a second ring that passed through the first ring? Dr. Sauvage figured that out in 1983. A charged copper ion essentially acted as a pin around which to form the interlocking rings, he found. Once the rings were connected, the copper ion could be removed. These molecules became known as catenanes. The pieces of the molecule were held together mechanically, like links in a chain, rather than the usual chemical bonds. Dr. Stoddart made the next advance in 1991. Instead of two interlocking rings, Dr. Stoddart, then at the University of Birmingham in Britain, and his colleagues synthesized a rotaxane: a ring molecule wrapped around a   axle. The ring slides back and forth along the dumbbell, like a bead on an abacus. Dr. Stoddart went on to construct a small computer chip that was essentially a molecular abacus, as well as other complex devices. One was composed of three rotaxanes whose rings were connected to form a larger platform that could rise 0. 7 billionths of a meter: a molecular elevator. Rotaxanes bending thin layers of gold acted like an artificial muscle, he found. As a sidelight, Dr. Sauvage and Dr. Stoddart used their techniques to create molecules that twisted in complicated knots. Dr. Stoddart said in an interview that he was inspired by the interlocking forms in Celtic art. Dr. Feringa, in 1999, became the first person to develop a molecular motor, creating a minuscule rotor blade powered by light that spun continually in the same direction. The first motor was not fast, but 15 years later, he and his research group demonstrated one that spun 12 million times per second. In 2011, they built a    molecular \u201ccar. \u201d Four of the molecular motors acted as wheels, connected by a  . The three men invigorated the field of topological chemistry, the academy said on Wednesday. They were pioneers in the second wave of nanotechnology, a field that the physicist Richard P. Feynman, also a Nobel laureate, foresaw as early as 1959. He gave a seminal lecture in 1984, toward the end of his life, on design and engineering at the molecular scale. In living organisms, nature has produced a slew of molecular machines that ferry materials around cells, construct proteins and divide cells. Artificial molecular machines are still primitive by comparison, but scientists can already envision applications in the future. \u201cThink about nanomachines, microrobots,\u201d said Dr. Feringa, who spoke by telephone with journalists assembled in Stockholm at the prize announcement. \u201cThink about tiny robots that the doctor in the future will inject in your blood veins, and they go search for cancer cells or going to deliver drugs, for instance. \u201d The technology could also lead to the creation of \u201csmart materials\u201d that change properties based on external signals, Dr. Feringa said. Dr. Sauvage, 71, was born in Paris and received his Ph. D. in 1971 from the University of Strasbourg in France, where he is a professor emeritus. He is also director of research emeritus at the National Center for Scientific Research in France. Dr. Stoddart, 74, was born in Edinburgh, received his Ph. D. in 1966 from Edinburgh University, and is a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He previously taught at U. C. L. A. and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to science. Dr. Feringa, 64, was born in   the Netherlands, and received his Ph. D. in 1978 from the University of Groningen, where he is a professor of organic chemistry. Dr. Feringa said he was \u201ca bit shocked\u201d when he got the phone call telling him he had received the Nobel. \u201cI feel a little bit like the Wright brothers, who were flying 100 years ago for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Why do we need a flying machine?\u2019 And now we have a Boeing 747 and an Airbus. \u201d The molecular discovery \u201copens up a whole new world of nanomachines,\u201d he said, while acknowledging that, as scientists figure out how to make machines that can operate autonomously, \u201cwe have to think about how we can handle these things safely. \u201d Dr. Stoddart\u2019s name had been mentioned for the Nobel for years. \u201cIt really got to the point where I didn\u2019t take it very seriously,\u201d he said. He was asleep when the phone rang at 4 a. m. \u201cI detected a Swedish accent, and I thought it was probably not a prank,\u201d Dr. Stoddart said. When told that he was sharing the prize with Dr. Sauvage and Dr. Feringa, \u201cI was totally delighted, because these are my scientific brothers in many ways,\u201d he said. James M. Tour, a professor of chemistry at Rice University in Houston, said the Nobel would bestow legitimacy on the field and help convince people that nanomachines are not just fantastical science fiction of the far future. \u201cNo one is making money on these right now, but it will come,\u201d he said. \u201cThese men have established and built up the field in a remarkable way. \u201d Dr. Tour predicted that the first profitable use of the technology might be machines that open up cell membranes in the body to deliver drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be quite extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u25a0 Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for \u201c . \u201d \u25a0 David J. Thouless, F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz shared the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for their research into the bizarre properties of matter in extreme states.

O. Scott", "text": "The first part of \u201cLion,\u201d Garth Davis\u2019s unabashedly   movie about a remarkable   incident, has some of the scary, wondrous feeling of a fairy tale. The audience is invited to imagine a   time  \u2014   1986, to be precise  \u2014   before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) who accidentally travels more than 1, 000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta. Saroo\u2019s mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an    train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language. With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroo\u2019s situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling. What happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated. Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) who was also adopted from India and has mental health and   problems. Despite that, Saroo seems to be living in the    stage of the fairy tale. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student, Lucy (Rooney Mara) from America. But memories of his   life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. It\u2019s not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if you\u2019re not familiar with the true story behind \u201cLion,\u201d that the fairy tale will come true. Mr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin O\u2019Halloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child  \u2014   or a mother  \u2014   this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent. Still, it isn\u2019t quite satisfying. The transition from the young to the   Saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that \u201cLion\u201d doesn\u2019t quite achieve. What felt in the first part like wonderful, Spielbergian simplicity feels, in the latter sections, like simplification. There isn\u2019t enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older Saroo a full identity. The movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back. At the end, the focus shifts from the agonies of Saroo to the glories of Google. I can\u2019t complain too much about that for all I know, Google brought you to this review. But I also can\u2019t help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm don\u2019   fuzzies, a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable. It is indeed remarkable how small the world has become, how many problems data can solve, how connected we all are to one another. But we\u2019ve lost something, too, and we can\u2019t even see what it is. \u201cLion\u201d is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned) for sex and profanity.

[The chemical agent did not affect U. S. forces and is still undergoing testing, said Maj. Gen. Joseph Martin, the commander of U. S. and coalition ground forces in Iraq.  \u201cDaesh has used chemicals in the vicinity of Mosul. The chemicals have had no impact on the Iraqi Security Forces. They had no impact on our forces,\u201d Martin said, using a derogatory Arabic acronym for ISIS. A U. S. defense official said U. S. forces donned protective gear. Australian troops were not exposed to the substance, according to an article by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Australian medics provided some Iraqi forces first aid after the attack. A U. S. defense official said those Iraqi forces have returned to duty. It is not the first time ISIS has used chemical weapons in Iraq. The U. S.  military coalition confirmed in 2015 the first instances of the terrorist group using sulfur mustard and mustard gas. An assessment by IHS Conflict Monitor found in November 2015 that ISIS has used chemicals, including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents, at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria since 2014. Martin said the chemicals ISIS has used in the past are all \u201c \u201d because of the group\u2019s lack of production capability. He said the chemicals were believed to have been delivered by indirect fire, meaning via rocket or some projectile containing the chemical agent. Martin said U. S. forces have the appropriate equipment and training to protect themselves from chemical weapons. The attack also raised the question of how closely U. S. forces are operating with Iraqi forces. Officials have said U. S. troops are not on the front lines fighting ISIS. However, Martin indicated they are close together and share the same risks. Martin said U. S. forces are with Iraqi security forces at \u201cvarious command and control locations throughout Iraq. \u201d \u201cBeing forward with those command and control facilities, they share the same risks the Iraqis do,\u201d he said. He added that U. S. forces are \u201cforward with the Iraqis each and every day. \u201d A defense official of unknown nationality told ABC that Australian and U. S. advisers were with Iraqi forces at the time of the attack. Martin characterized ISIS as getting increasingly desperate, as Iraqi forces  \u2014   backed by the U. S.  military coalition  \u2014   are succeeding in pushing the terrorist group out of their main stronghold in Iraq. Martin said ISIS members were turning on civilians, killing hundreds each week. \u201cAs I see it, the longer this fight goes on in west Mosul, the civilians will suffer at the hands of a brutal enemy. This is why ISIS must be defeated quickly,\u201d he said. He said ISIS was using civilians as human shields and fighting from protected sites. \u201cISIS uses the tactic of taking civilians hostage for protection while they\u2019re fighting from protected sites. ISIS has been indiscriminate in their use of [  improvised explosive devices] and building IEDs to kill, maim and injure innocent civilians as part of their ongoing campaign of terror,\u201d he said. Martin said ISIS\u2019s \u201cleadership has fled and their days are numbered. \u201d Meanwhile, he said, Iraqi forces were getting better. \u201cThey continue to improve their capability and demonstrate a level of professionalism that makes me proud to serve with them.

Brown told him that there was a U.S. Marshal\u2019s hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada. \nOregon Standoff defendant Jeff Banta is relieved by acquittals \n\u201cIf there\u2019s a detainer, show me,\u201d Mumford stood, arguing before the judge. \nSuddenly, a group of about six U.S. Marshals surrounded Mumford at his defense table. The judge directed them to move back but moments later, the marshals grabbed on to him. \n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Mumford yelled, as he struggled and was taken down to the floor. \nAs deputy marshals yelled, \u201cStop resisting,\u201d the judge demanded, \u201cEverybody out of the courtroom now!\u201d \nMumford was taken into custody, a member of his legal team confirmed. \nAmmon Bundy\u2019s lawyer J. Morgan Philpot, said afterwards on the courthouse steps that Mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun, or Taser, on his back. Another member of Ammon Bundy\u2019s legal team Rick Koerber, echoed Philpot, saying he heard Mumford questioning in court why they were using a Taser against him. \nPhilpot decried the marshals\u2019 treatment of Mumford in the courtroom. \u201cWhat happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government,\u201d he said. \nBy 6:30 p.m., Mumford was released from custody. He confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom. \n\u201cI grew up on a dairy farm, so am I used to some rough treatment, sure?\u201d he said. But he said the actions of the U.S. marshals were uncalled for. \n\u201cAll I was asking for was papers. Just show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody.\u201d \nAs to the verdict, \u201cVery pleased, very gratified. This jury was dedicated. They listened to our case.\u201d \nJust after the verdicts were announced, people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers. \nSupporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug. One of them, Brand Thornton of Las Vegas, one of the original occupiers who accompanied Ryan Bundy and others onto the refuge on Jan. 2 and was called as witness by the defense, said that he has been at the trial since Oct. 2. \nThe verdict \u201cmeans everything,\u201d Thornton said. It\u2019s huge for ranchers and land rights within Harney County and across the West, he said. \n\u201cWe did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful,\u201d said Thornton, who has kept vigil outside the courthouse, blowing a shofar. \n\u201cThis is for the people of Oregon,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cThis was never for us.\u201d \nWampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a \u201cstunning victory for rural America.\u201d \nDavid Fry\u2019s lawyer Per C. Olson said, \u201cIt was the right result.\u201d \n\u201cI think the jury saw through this that they were well-meaning, well-intentioned individuals,\u201d Olson said. The jury saw that the defendants cared about the Hammonds and didn\u2019t like how the federal government was treating them. \nMaxfield, who represented Wampler, came out of the courthouse, holding up her fists. She said she has never seen \u201canything like this happen,\u201d where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted, and called it one of the most significant cases in her career. \nDefendant Shawna Cox said she had a \u201cpeaceful feeling,\u201d as she waited for the verdicts, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t expect we\u2019d all be found not guilty.\u201d \n\u201cI wept,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIt brings me to tears. I\u2019m so grateful to the jury.\u201d \nDefense lawyer Matthew Schindler, standby counsel to defendant Kenneth Medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments, said he called his client right away. \n\u201cHe\u2019s been fighting for more than 20 years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him,\u201d Schindler said. \u201cIt\u2019s vindication.\u201d \nSchindler said he believes the jury\u2019s verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the \u201cintent\u201d of the defendants was to conspire against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management. \n\u201cThe judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendant\u2019s state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations,\u201d Schindler said. \nWhen prosecuting a drug conspiracy, it\u2019s easy to point to what the defendants\u2019 underlying objective is. But in this case, Schindler said, there was \u201cno obvious underlying self interest.\u201d He said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state, and not just from Portland. \nOregon U.S. Attorney Billy Williams sat in the back of the courtroom with Oregon\u2019s FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregg Bretzing as the verdicts were read. Williams left the courtroom early, before the scrum with Mumford, to attend a gathering of the League of Minority Voters in Salem Thursday night. \nHarney County Sheriff Dave Ward, who was the face of law enforcement during the 41-day refuge takeover, said in a statement, \u201cWhile I am disappointed in the outcome, I believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world. These folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers. This is our system, and I stand by it.\u201d \nThe five-week trial offered a rare display: Three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves. Five of them were among the more than 80 people who took the witness stand to testify. \nAnd one of the original 12 jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations \u2013 what the judge called an \u201cextraordinary circumstance.\u201d An alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining 11 jurors Thursday morning. \nThere was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial, with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests, and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings. \nOften, supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings, and some kept vigil across the street, with one fellow occupier blowing a ram\u2019s horn, or shofar, as the jury deliberated. \nPENDING PROSECUTIONS \nThe seven on trial were among 26 people indicted on the conspiracy charge. \nEleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. \nSeven others are set for trial on Feb. 14, but their cases may be affected by the verdicts. If convictions are handed down in this case, then defendants scheduled for trial in February might consider potential pleas. If there are acquittals, prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against co-defendants next year. \nOn the eve of jury selection in this case, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against Pete Santilli, an independent broadcaster and self-described \u201cshock jock,\u201d who provided live stream footage of the occupation. \nNEVADA CASE \nAmmon Bundy and Ryan Bundy also face prosecution in Nevada in the 2014 standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their father\u2019s cattle near Bunkerville, Nevada. \nThe trial there is set to start Feb. 6. The two brothers and father Cliven Bundy are among 19 indicted in Nevada. Others from the Oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in Nevada are Pete Santilli, Ryan Payne, Brian Cavalier, Blaine Cooper and Joseph O\u2019Shaughnessy. \nPayne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in Oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with Nevada prosecutors, but he recently asked to withdraw the Oregon plea because no deal was reached in Nevada. Prosecutors in Portland have until Oct. 31 to respond. \nCooper entered guilty pleas in both cases. O\u2019Shaughnessy pleaded guilty in the Oregon case, with a deal pending in Nevada. Cavalier pleaded guilty in the Oregon case. \n\u2014 Maxine Bernstein", "label": "1"}, {"title": "Clinton Campaign STUNNED As FBI Reportedly Reopens Probe Into Hillary Clinton Emails", "author": "The Doc", "text": "Clinton Campaign STUNNED As FBI Reportedly Reopens Probe Into Hillary Clinton Emails Posted on Tweet Home \u00bb Headlines \u00bb World News \u00bb Clinton Campaign STUNNED As FBI Reportedly Reopens Probe Into Hillary Clinton Emails \nA SHOCKING blow to the Clinton Campaign emerged unexpectedly Friday as the FBI has reportedly REOPENED probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server as \u201cThe FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d \n\n\nHere we go\u2026 \nYes.

The organizers for the event, the March for Life, had extended invitations to President Trump and Mr. Pence. A senior White House official confirmed that Mr. Pence would address the marchers. Mr. Pence\u2019s appearance will come just a few days before Mr. Trump is expected to reveal his nominee for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice  Antonin Scalia  last year. Mr. Trump has said his pick, like Mr. Scalia, would oppose abortion rights, one of several promises he has made to roll back legal protections for the procedure. Other Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, have spoken to the march, but remotely.   leaders see the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to their cause and the looming Supreme Court nomination battle as a tipping point after eight years of a Democratic administration. The symbolism of hearing from Mr. Pence and another senior Trump administration official, Kellyanne Conway, at the march is hard to overlook. Mr. Trump eventually won over many reluctant   leaders who had chafed at his past support for abortion rights and his history of being a    role model for religious conservatives. Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges to them, which he made in writing before the election, have gone a long way to rebuilding trust.   activists say they are among the most detailed and serious pledges a president has made to their cause.

The same principle applies to our daily wastes. \nIn case you did not know it, Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. Actually, I would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and that\u2019s nothing to be proud of. \nWe waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. Also, as a nation, the United States generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. \nIf you crunch these numbers\u2013 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste \u2013 you\u2019ll come up with astonishing numbers. \nPutting Waste to Work for Energy \nIt was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted \u2013 everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. To follow this guy\u2019s axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . \nWe, the preppers, can help mitigate the \u201cdisaster\u201d and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. \nBriquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material \u2013 usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust \u2013 that are used to start a fire. The terms derives from the French language and it means \u201cbrick.\u201d \nBiomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. Traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and they\u2019re used as a \u201cgreen\u201d replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. \nCurrently, almost half of the world\u2019s population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. \nCutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and that\u2019s the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving   humans, right? \nAny household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making \u201cfuel briquettes\u201d using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. \nHow to Make the Briquettes \nSo, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste. \nIt\u2019s important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. \nAs a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but you\u2019ll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. \nThere are also commercially available presses. You\u2019ll just have to look for them on the internet or in   \nThe fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses. You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \nYou can also use a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \nBasically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. You\u2019ll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. \nHere\u2019s a cool idea about DIY-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container. The possibilities are basically endless. \nVideo first seen on nobodyprepper . \nHow to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps \nStep 1 \u2013 preparing the briquette mix \nFor example, if you\u2019re going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective), you\u2019ll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. \nIn the next step, you\u2019ll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the \u201csoup\u201d. This step is very important but it takes some time and you\u2019ll have to do it well. \nTo speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. \nThe simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. You can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as they\u2019ll add to the flavor. You\u2019ll have to use roughly 20% paper though \u2013 that\u2019s the lesson to be taken home. \nYou can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the paper\u2019s binding properties into the sawdust-mix. You\u2019ll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. \nIn the next step, you\u2019ll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. The mix must hold together if squeezed; that\u2019s how you determine the ideal consistency. \nStep 2 \u2013 prepare the press \nThis step depends on whether you\u2019re using a cool home press or an improvised device. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re on the low-tech side and you\u2019re using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. \nYou\u2019ll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. You can use a hot wire to burn the holes. \nThen you\u2019ll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. Don\u2019t forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. \nObviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. Ideally you\u2019ll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. Don\u2019t forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though \u2013 otherwise, the water won\u2019t drain and you\u2019re wasting your time. \nStep 3 \u2013 press the mix \nIn this step, you\u2019ll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. Then you\u2019ll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. \nPush as hard as you can \u2013 the harder the better. Then you\u2019ll have to pull the bag out of the mold and here\u2019s your first briquette, folks. \nStep 4 \u2013 dry your briquettes \nBut it\u2019s not over yet. You\u2019ll have to dry your briquettes for about a week outside in the sun. If they\u2019re not properly dried, the briquettes will smoke when burned and that\u2019s unpleasant to say the least. \nIf you can\u2019t improvise a mold and/or a press, you can always make fuel-briquettes with just your hands, squeezing the mix in your bare hands and building fuel balls and you\u2019ll have to dry these out too, obviously. \nThere are so many survival things you can do by yourself.   discover   wood creations. \n\n  5 total views, 5 views today", "label": "1"}, {"title": "Treason!

What Does That Mean? - The New York Times", "author": "Jacey Fortin", "text": "What does it mean to \u201cdress like a woman\u201d? Social media users took it upon themselves to answer that very question in response to a report that President Trump wants women who work for him to look a certain way. The sentiment was anonymously cited in the new newsletter Axios from Mike Allen, a former Politico reporter. In response, Twitter erupted with a stream of photos showing women dressed for the jobs they hold and the lives they lead, as firefighters, soldiers, police officers and astronauts, to name a few. But while many of the tweets were aimed at rejecting the idea that women should be restricted to some narrow sartorial category, the \u201cdress like a woman\u201d phrase,   as a hashtag, didn\u2019t come directly from Mr. Trump. In his newsletter, Mr. Allen attributed the phrase this way: In an email on Friday afternoon, Mr. Allen declined to offer any further details. It\u2019s clear that appearances matter to the president. Mr. Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe Organization, has come under harsh criticism for rating women\u2019s appearances on a scale of one to 10 and for hurling insults at female critics. As a candidate, he readily attacked when people commented on the size of his hands or on his hair. Like presidents past, Mr. Trump will most likely have some influence over style in the West Wing. The White House does not have an official dress code, according to its Press Office, but every administration has its own norms. For the past two decades, wardrobes have tended to be more relaxed in Democratic administrations. Under President Clinton, \u201caides frequently attended meetings in jeans and \u201d The New York Times reported in 2001. President George W. Bush restored formality to the West Wing, but President Obama was so relaxed that he broke with protocol, foregoing a suit jacket on his first full day in the Oval Office. If the pattern holds, dressing for work in the West Wing could become more formal under the Trump administration. Whether that means women would be required to \u201cdress like women\u201d remains to be seen.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "At 91, Ella Brennan Still Feeds (and Leads) New Orleans - The New York Times", "author": "Brett Anderson", "text": "NEW ORLEANS  \u2014   A typical evening for Ella Brennan begins with cocktails. They are delivered from Commander\u2019s Palace, her family\u2019s restaurant next door to her mansion in this city\u2019s historic Garden District. Drinks are often followed by dinner, also from Commander\u2019s, and wine. Ms. Brennan favors Champagne and distinguished whites from the C\u00f4te de Beaune because, as she puts it, \u201cI\u2019m too damn old to drink cheap wine\u201d and \u201cbecause I can. \u201d In New Orleans, there is little question that Miss Ella, as Ms. Brennan is widely known here, has earned her sense of entitlement. Her hometown\u2019s civic pride is tightly linked to its reputation for culinary excellence Ms. Brennan helped create that reputation, and has made maintaining it a personal responsibility for more than 60 years. At 91, she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1, 400 people, both full and part time, and she has mentored countless talents, including the celebrity chefs Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse. \u201cShe was there to embrace and elevate, not just me but the entire staff,\u201d said Mr. Lagasse, whom Ms. Brennan plucked from obscurity and installed, at age 23, as Commander\u2019s chef in the early 1980s. \u201cThe list of people she has impacted in the hospitality industry in America is endless. \u201d Ms. Brennan\u2019s family has recently set out to ensure that her legacy is appreciated beyond New Orleans. Those efforts culminated last year with the release of a memoir, \u201cMiss Ella of Commander\u2019s Palace,\u201d written with Ti Martin, her daughter. It was followed by the documentary \u201cElla Brennan: Commanding the Table,\u201d directed by Leslie Iwerks. The film, which has been screening at festivals, will be available on Netflix in May. The book and film tell the story of a     businesswoman  \u2014   her other nickname is Hurricane Ella  \u2014   who excelled in a   profession decades before gender imbalance in the restaurant industry became a hot issue. \u201cWhen I first started, you would hardly ever see another woman in the kitchen, much less running the show,\u201d said Sue Zemanick, the former chef at Gautreau\u2019s, a \u201cTop Chef Masters\u201d contestant and a line cook at Commander\u2019s early in her career. \u201cWorking at a restaurant with such strong women in charge gave me hope that I could make it. \u201d While Ms. Brennan is, as Ms. Martin put it, \u201cas retired as Mom is capable of being,\u201d her New Orleans restaurants, which include Caf\u00e9 Adelaide and SoBou, remain an obsession for her they are managed by Ms. Martin and Lally Brennan, a niece of Ms. Brennan. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Brennan sat next to the unlit fireplace in her living room. As she moved a sore leg back and forth between an ottoman and the floor, she suggested that her impulse to empower employees was a rejection of restaurant industry norms she confronted as a young woman. \u201cIn those days, no one was paying attention to developing people,\u201d she said. \u201cA restaurateur has to be part of a team to make something everyone can be proud of. \u201d Her decision to tap Mr. Prudhomme, a Cajun, to run Commander\u2019s kitchen in the 1970s loosened the grip that   chefs had on American fine dining. Alongside Ms. Brennan, and later on his own, the   Mr. Prudhomme helped set the table for a renaissance in American regional cooking that has yet to abate. \u201cNew Orleans was really the centerpiece of the whole American food movement,\u201d the New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent said. \u201cAnd Ella put New Orleans on the map. \u201d Ms. Brennan entered the hospitality business as a teenager working at the Old Absinthe House, a Bourbon Street bar owned by her brother Owen, 15 years her senior. She had dropped out of a local business school after deciding, as she wrote in her book, that \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to type for any man. \u201d In 1946, Mr. Brennan bought Vieux Carr\u00e9, a French Quarter restaurant that Ms. Brennan described recently, with typical candor, as \u201cterrible. \u201d Mr. Brennan hired her to manage the business, looking to prove that an Irish family could operate a restaurant superior to established   restaurants like Arnaud\u2019s, Antoine\u2019s and Galatoire\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d Ms. Brennan recalled. \u201cBut Owen was a raconteur. He slept till noon. He got me to do all of the things he didn\u2019t like. So I learned. \u201d A voracious reader, she pored over books recommended by the restaurant\u2019s two chefs, Jack Eames and Paul Blang\u00e9, whose respect she sought and whom she frequently praised. \u201cI was amazed at their talent,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were like surgeons. \u201d The gregarious Brennan family  \u2014   the other siblings were Dick, Adelaide, Dottie and John  \u2014   cultivated a clientele of influential locals and visitors, including celebrities. All the while, Ms. Brennan worked with the chefs to elevate Vieux Carr\u00e9\u2019s food. For inspiration, she traveled frequently to New York City, where she became a regular at the \u201c21\u201d Club. Culinary pioneers like James Beard and Helen McCully, the food editor of McCall\u2019s magazine, took the young visitor under their wings. \u201cYou had to go to New York in those days,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cI was trying to get New Orleans to that level. \u201d In 1955, the Brennans were preparing to relocate Vieux Carr\u00e9 to a larger space on Royal Street when Owen died of a heart attack at 45. It fell to Ms. Brennan to carry out her brother\u2019s vision for the new restaurant, which would be called Brennan\u2019s. By all accounts, Brennan\u2019s ushered in a new age for fine dining in the South. It became a grand showcase for New Orleans joie de vivre, replete with a wine cellar, antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional   cuisine. The national press took notice, especially of its boozy, multicourse breakfasts. \u201cAmerica was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment,\u201d Ms. Brennan wrote, \u201cand all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food. \u201d Ms. Brennan helped develop new dishes, including bananas Foster. She pushed to expand the family\u2019s restaurant properties, with spotty success, aggravating a rift between Owen\u2019s heirs and what came to be known as \u201cElla\u2019s side\u201d of the family. In 1973, Ms. Brennan was dismissed from Brennan\u2019s, initiating a bitter, litigious family split that has never fully healed. \u201cIt was a tragedy,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cFamily is everything to us. \u201d (Owen Brennan\u2019s sons continued to run Brennan\u2019s until 2013, when a group that includes Ralph Brennan, a son of John Brennan, purchased the   property at a sheriff\u2019s auction. Brennan\u2019s of Houston, overseen by Ms. Brennan\u2019s son Alex, is part of her restaurant group.) Commander\u2019s Palace, which Ms. Brennan acquired in 1969, was a sprawling property in need of repair. In partnership with her sisters and brothers, she set about turning it into a restaurant that would eclipse Brennan\u2019s. Early reviews weren\u2019t favorable. But over time, Commander\u2019s became renowned for its sophisticated blending of south Louisiana and nouvelle cuisines  \u2014   Ms. Brennan christened the style haute Creole  \u2014   and its warm, celebratory approach to fine dining. \u201cWe want people who eat here to feel important, and we want them to have fun,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. Ms. Brennan never presumed that her management responsibilities ended at the kitchen door. Alex McCrery, a Commander\u2019s line cook in the early 2000s, recalled that Ms. Brennan admonished another cook for proposing that the kitchen make mustard ice cream. \u201cShe was the type who was like your mom is when she is disappointed in you,\u201d Mr. McCrery said. \u201cShe was stern, and you\u2019d feel like you really messed up. \u201d Ms. Brennan said she \u201cgave up men for Lent\u201d after her divorce in 1970 from Paul Martin. She also never learned to cook (\u201cI don\u2019t think she can boil water,\u201d Mr. Lagasse said) but that doesn\u2019t prevent her from giving lavish dinner parties in the home she shares with Dottie. \u201cWe don\u2019t carry on like we once did,\u201d she said before a recent meal. \u201cBut I do like to take advantage of living next door to my restaurant. \u201d A waiter carried Ms. Brennan\u2019s drink as she moved, with the aid of a walker, from her   parlor to her   dining room. She sat at the head of the table as Commander\u2019s waiters delivered a series of courses from the restaurant\u2019s kitchen. As she sank her spoon into a steaming sea urchin and stone crab souffl\u00e9, Ms. Brennan explained that entertaining gives her an opportunity to weigh in on new ideas from Tory McPhail, Commander\u2019s current and   chef. It also allows her to partake in the kind of pleasure she has provided others for so long. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here tonight is letting him experiment on us,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. McPhail, who had just introduced a course of lamb osso buco.

As China challenges the United States for influence in Asia, the administration is concerned that any criticism of nations like Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Laos for backsliding on human rights could alienate them rather than pulling them closer. At the same time, shining a spotlight on China\u2019s own rough treatment of dissidents risks losing Beijing\u2019s cooperation on issues like trade, climate change and nuclear proliferation. Rights advocates accused the administration of being too timid, arguing that the United States should put as much pressure on governments over how they treat their citizens as they do during trade negotiations. \u201cDecades of experience should make clear to Washington that Beijing responds only to the expectation of unpleasant consequences,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch. \u201cWhy not threaten sanctions, cut out the pointless pomp or visibly align with peaceful critics of the government?\u201d she said. \u201cOn other diplomatic, economic and security issues, governments recognize and use these points of leverage. Why not on human rights?\u201d Others say Mr. Obama, who speaks openly about civil rights in the United States, has been wise not to inject the issue into talks with China, even as Beijing has carried out the most sweeping crackdown on Chinese civil society in nearly 20 years. They say the president understands that a more powerful China is better able to resist American pressure on human rights than it was a decade ago. \u201cTo its credit, the Obama administration has not exacerbated the many U. S.  economic and security issues with a   human rights policy,\u201d said Robert S. Ross, a professor of political science at Boston College. \u201cIt is quite a stretch to argue that diplomacy could persuade an authoritarian,   government to undermine its domestic political power by allowing greater opposition to the government and tolerating greater political instability. \u201d The pattern is now extending beyond China\u2019s borders. During Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Laos, a tiny country run by a repressive Communist regime, he so far has chosen not to publicly raise the case of an   civil rights worker who disappeared at a police checkpoint four years ago. He has refrained, at least in public, from criticizing the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has been unapologetic about waging a violent war against drugs in the first two months of his term. On Wednesday, a day after Mr. Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with Mr. Duterte, who had unleashed a   diatribe against him, the two men met informally. During Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Vietnam in May, he agreed to lift a longstanding ban on the sale of lethal weapons without winning significant concessions on human rights. And after trying to draw Malaysia closer, Mr. Obama has been embarrassed by the country\u2019s prime minister, Najib Razak, who has closed online news outlets and prosecuted opposition figures in an effort to stay in power. The Obama administration has pressed China on human rights in a   way on only a few occasions. In 2012, the American Embassy in Beijing harbored Chen Guangcheng, a blind Chinese dissident, and flew him to the United States. But the days when the White House could demand and expect the release of a few Chinese political prisoners before a summit meeting are gone, Professor Ross said. As the Chinese Communist Party gained confidence, it began rearresting dissidents who had been released before American summit meetings. \u201cSince then,\u201d Professor Ross said, \u201cU. S. human rights diplomacy has been reduced to rhetoric, which, no surprise, has not improved China\u2019s human rights situation. \u201d Despite Mr. Obama\u2019s fleeting public reference to religious repression this week, for example, few expect the Chinese authorities to retreat from a campaign against Christian churches in the area surrounding Hangzhou, the city that hosted the Group of 20 meeting. One of the new challenges for Mr. Obama, and one for his successor, will be how to deal with Mr. Duterte. The police in the Philippines say they have killed about 1, 000 suspects in the antidrug campaign, and about 300 people have been killed by vigilantes. Rights groups have urged the United States to do something about the situation. \u201cIt\u2019d be difficult for us to overstate how grave the situation has become in the Philippines,\u201d said John Sifton, the deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cAt this rate, we\u2019re talking about over 6, 000 people dead by the end of the year. \u201d But the Philippines is an American ally and a bulwark against Chinese military gains in the South China Sea. By that calculus, the United States cannot afford to alienate Mr. Duterte. Philippine analysts say that Mr. Duterte is on good terms with Chinese business executives who invested in Davao, the city where he served as mayor, and that he may be open to negotiating with Beijing over the South China Sea. Under American legislation known as the Leahy Amendment, Washington is obliged to cut off assistance to Philippines law enforcement units that are suspected of human rights abuses. But Antonio La Vi\u00f1a, a professor of government at Ateneo de Manila University, said the threat of such a sanction was unlikely to be effective. \u201cThe truth is that the Philippines has the money to modernize our military,\u201d he said. Mr. Obama is the first sitting American president to visit Laos, and he has sought to promote reconciliation with the nation, on which the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs at the height of the Vietnam War. But he is also being called on to press Laos\u2019s repressive government  \u2014   a traditional ally of China  \u2014   on the case of Sombath Somphone, a civil rights campaigner and   agriculture specialist who disappeared at a police checkpoint in the capital, Vientiane, four years ago. Mr. Obama will also have to decide how hard to push concerns about human rights with other leaders at the meeting, several of whom are being wooed by China. One of Mr. Obama\u2019s favorite Southeast Asian leaders, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, is scheduled to visit the White House this month, and American officials hope to make progress on addressing the plight of the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority in the predominantly Buddhist country. More than 100, 000 Rohingya live in   camps in northern Myanmar, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has appointed a commission that includes the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan to find solutions. \u201cShe has demonstrated a recognition that this is a problem that must be solved,\u201d said Tom Malinowski, the United States assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor. The Obama administration has been less vocal on conditions in Vietnam, which it has tried to steer closer to the United States in the face of Chinese pressure over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Since then, the human rights situation has only deteriorated, said Nguyen Quang A, an activist and a former member of the Vietnamese Communist Party who was invited to meet Mr. Obama in Hanoi but who was stopped by Vietnamese security forces. Political prisoners remain in jail, the news media is muzzled, and independent labor unions have not been allowed, despite promises to Washington. \u201cShould Obama have done more to try and influence the government of Vietnam?\u201d Mr. Quang A asked. \u201cAbsolutely. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Democrats Have a 60 Percent Chance to Retake the Senate - The New York Times", "author": "Josh Katz", "text": "The Upshot\u2019s new Senate election forecast gives Democrats a 60 percent chance of winning control of the chamber in November. Included within this 60 percent is a 17 percent chance that the Senate ends up evenly split with a Democratic vice president providing the tiebreaking vote. By our count, the Democrats need to win five seats among the 11 most competitive races. (The Democrats will need to win six if Donald J. Trump wins the presidential race we put Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning at only  11 percent). Ten of these seats are held by Republicans, and one by a Democrat, Harry Reid of Nevada, who is retiring. That the Democrats are favored in this election should not be surprising. The 2016 Senate elections boded well for the Democrats without any consideration of a possible Trump effect on   races. In recent history, Democrats have done better in presidential election years than in midterm years, when turnout is lower. Most of the senators up for   last went before the voters in the Republican wave election of 2010  \u2014   when the G. O. P. made big and broad gains in an   environment  \u2014   leaving Republicans with several potentially vulnerable incumbents. This year, the Democrats are defending only 10 seats while the Republicans have to preserve 24. On fundamentals alone  \u2014   that is, historical voting patterns, the candidates\u2019 political experience and    \u2014   the Democrats would have about a   shot to win the Senate. The latest Senate polling improves this figure to 60 percent. The framework for our model is broadly similar to the approach we took in 2014, when our Election Day forecast correctly called 35 of 36 Senate races. That approach means starting with the fundamentals as a prior, then updating those beliefs as polling information comes in. We let races affect one another and assume that the    errors will be correlated. The main difference between 2014 and this year is that we have some additional information to gauge candidates\u2019 chances in a presidential year. Previous research suggests that there is a strong relationship between presidential and Senate voting. Accordingly, our model assumes that Senate races will track the presidential race in each state to some degree. That is, if Hillary Clinton has improved her standing in the presidential forecast since the last time a state has been polled, we \u201c \u201d the Senate polling average a small amount in the same direction. Incumbents are running in seven of the 10 seats being defended by Democrats. All seven seats are considered safe. For the other three: \u25a0 Democrats are guaranteed to win the seat in California: Barbara Boxer is retiring, and two Democrats  \u2014   Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez  \u2014   won the top two spots in an open primary. \u25a0 Initial polling in Maryland showed the Democratic candidate, Chris Van Hollen, up by 20 to 30 points. \u25a0 It\u2019s only in Nevada, where Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to replace Mr. Reid, where the election is competitive. This leaves Democrats with 36 seats that are not up for election this year  \u2014   including two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who both caucus with Democrats  \u2014   in addition to nine safe seats. Much of the weakness in the Republican position comes from seven G. O. P. incumbents in mostly   states trying to win a second term after first being elected in the Republican wave year of 2010: Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Mark Kirk in Illinois, Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Roy Blunt in Missouri, Rob Portman in Ohio, and Marco Rubio in Florida (assuming he wins the Republican primary next week). In addition, the retirement of the Republican Dan Coats along with the entry of the former Democratic senator Evan Bayh in the race in Indiana shifted that seat from a likely Republican hold to a possible Democratic pickup. Richard Burr\u2019s seat in North Carolina also seems vulnerable. Polling indicates that even Senator John McCain of Arizona could be swept out by the encroaching Democratic tide. If Mr. McCain beats back a primary challenge from the Tea Party candidate Kelli Ward, he will face a Democratic challenger, Ann Kirkpatrick, who was within two points in a June poll. Our model gives Ms. Kirkpatrick a roughly    chance of taking the seat. To give themselves a cushion in retaking the Senate, Democrats would probably need to win six of these 11 races: the seven elections with   Republicans the elections in Indiana, Arizona and North Carolina and the contest for Mr. Reid\u2019s seat in Nevada. If Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency and they win five seats, they will most likely control that chamber because the vice president has the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. With so many seats remaining uncertain, the race could still tip in either direction, with Republicans possibly retaining a slim majority or Democrats running the table.

The memo, a draft of which was provided to The New York Times by a State Department official, says American policy has been \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the unrelenting violence in Syria. It calls for \u201ca judicious use of   and air weapons, which would undergird and drive a more focused and   U. S.  diplomatic process. \u201d Such a step would represent a radical shift in the administration\u2019s approach to the civil war in Syria, and there is little evidence that President Obama has plans to change course. Mr. Obama has emphasized the military campaign against the Islamic State over efforts to dislodge Mr. Assad. Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, have all but collapsed. But the memo, filed in the State Department\u2019s \u201cdissent channel,\u201d underscores the deep rifts and lingering frustration within the administration over how to deal with a war that has killed more than 400, 000 people. The State Department set up the channel during the Vietnam War as a way for employees who had disagreements with policies to register their protest with the secretary of state and other top officials, without fear of reprisal. While dissent cables are not that unusual, the number of signatures on this document, 51, is extremely large, if not unprecedented. The names on the memo are almost all midlevel officials  \u2014   many of them career diplomats  \u2014   who have been involved in the administration\u2019s Syria policy over the last five years, at home or abroad. They range from a Syria desk officer in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to a former deputy to the American ambassador in Damascus. While there are no widely recognized names,   State Department officials are known to share their concerns. Mr. Kerry himself has pushed for stronger American action against Syria, in part to force a diplomatic solution on Mr. Assad. The president has resisted such pressure, and has been backed up by his military commanders, who have raised questions about what would happen in the event that Mr. Assad was forced from power  \u2014   a scenario that the draft memo does not address. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, declined to comment on the memo, which top officials had just received. But he said Mr. Kerry respected the process as a way for employees \u201cto express policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership. \u201d Robert S. Ford, a former ambassador to Syria, said, \u201cMany people working on Syria for the State Department have long urged a tougher policy with the Assad government as a means of facilitating arrival at a negotiated political deal to set up a new Syrian government. \u201d Mr. Ford, who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, resigned from the Foreign Service in 2014 out of frustration with the administration\u2019s   policy toward the conflict. In the memo, the State Department officials wrote that the Assad government\u2019s continuing violations of the partial   known as a cessation of hostilities, will doom efforts to broker a political settlement because Mr. Assad will feel no pressure to negotiate with the moderate opposition or other factions fighting him. The government\u2019s barrel bombing of civilians, it said, is the \u201croot cause of the instability that continues to grip Syria and the broader region. \u201d \u201cThe moral rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria, after five years of brutal war, is evident and unquestionable,\u201d it said. \u201cThe status quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire, if not disastrous, humanitarian, diplomatic and   challenges. \u201d The memo acknowledged that military action would have risks, not the least further tensions with Russia, which has intervened in the war on Mr. Assad\u2019s behalf and helped negotiate a  . Those tensions increased on Thursday when, according to a senior Pentagon official, Russia conducted airstrikes in southern Syria against   forces fighting the Islamic State. The State Department officials insisted in their memo that they were not \u201cadvocating for a slippery slope that ends in a military confrontation with Russia,\u201d but rather a credible threat of military action to keep Mr. Assad in line. Once that threat was in place, the memo said, Mr. Kerry could undertake a diplomatic mission similar to the one he led with Iran on its nuclear program. The expression of dissent came a week after Mr. Assad showed renewed defiance of the United States and other countries, vowing to retake \u201cevery inch\u201d of his country from his enemies. The   which Mr. Kerry helped negotiate in Munich last winter, has never really taken hold. Mr. Assad has continued to block humanitarian convoys, despite a warning that the United Nations would begin airdrops of food to starving towns. \u201cThere is an enormous frustration in the bureaucracy about Syria policy,\u201d said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy. \u201cWhat\u2019s brought this to a head now is the real downturn in the negotiations, not just between the U. S. and Russia, but between Assad and the opposition. \u201d Last month, Mr. Kerry rejected the suggestion that the United States and its allies would never use force to stop the bombings or enforce humanitarian access. \u201cIf President Assad has come to a conclusion there\u2019s no Plan B,\u201d he said, \u201cthen he\u2019s come to a conclusion that is totally without any foundation whatsoever and even dangerous. \u201d Still, Mr. Obama has shown little sign of shifting his focus from the campaign against the Islamic State  \u2014   a strategy that probably acquired even more urgency after the mass shooting Sunday in Orlando, Fla. In the memo, the State Department officials argued that military action against Mr. Assad would help the fight against the Islamic State because it would bolster moderate Sunnis, who are necessary allies against the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. While the State Department has a tradition of being open to dissent  \u2014   in the 1990s, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Foreign Service officers who had written a   dissent on the Clinton administration\u2019s Balkans policy  \u2014   Mr. Christopher and his successors have been frustrated when these classified memos become public. In this case, the memo mainly confirms what has been clear for some time: The State Department\u2019s rank and file have chafed at the White House\u2019s refusal to be drawn into the conflict in Syria. During a debate in June 2013, after the Assad government had used chemical weapons against its own people, Mr. Kerry brandished a State Department report that argued that the United States needed to respond militarily or Mr. Assad would view it as \u201cgreen light for continued CW use. \u201d Three years later, the sense of urgency at the State Department has not diminished. The memo concludes, \u201cIt is time that the United States, guided by our strategic interests and moral convictions, lead a global effort to put an end to this conflict once and for all. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Franken Calls for \u2019Independent Investigation\u2019 Into Trump\u2019s \u2019Putin Crush\u2019 - Breitbart", "author": "Pam Key", "text": "Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d in reacting to reports about President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s phone conversations with a Russian ambassador, Sen.

Here are some of the most significant elements of the new approach: In 2014, the Obama administration issued guidelines for deporting unauthorized immigrants that placed the highest priority on gang members, felons and those who posed security threats. A goal was to concentrate limited resources on the most serious cases, but many Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents complained that the priorities tied their hands, taking away their discretion as to whom to pursue. Under the new directives, the government \u201cno longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. \u201d Immigration agents can now focus on picking up and removing anyone charged with or convicted of any criminal offense, even minor ones, as well as anyone already ordered deported, regardless of whether they have a criminal record. One unauthorized immigrant in California, Kristina, who did not want her last name used because of fear of deportation, said she was alarmed to learn on Tuesday that she would now be considered a prime target. Kristina has been in the country for 25 years and has been ordered deported, but her removal had been postponed for the last four years by the Obama administration. \u201cWe have our whole lives here our children are citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know if I can go out, if I should drive. \u201d But the Obama guidelines \u201ctranslated into de facto protections\u201d for people with no legal right to live in the United States, said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants. Unless they fell into one of the   categories, Mr. Stein said, \u201cthe chance of being deported was virtually zero. \u201d Under the Obama administration, people caught crossing the border without permission were often released into the United States while their requests for asylum wound through the immigration system, a process that can take years. Most requests are denied, but by then, the immigrant has been living in the United States all that time and may not be easy to find. The Trump administration has declared an end to the   catch and release policy, though it may take awhile to see any significant change. \u201cCatch and release\u201d came about in part because the government had nowhere to hold detainees waiting for immigration decisions. One of the memos released on Tuesday directs officials to expand detention facilities, but it will take time to build centers big enough, or find enough room in jails, to hold the thousands of Mexican and Central American asylum seekers expected to cross the border this year. The document also raises another alternative: sending migrants back to Mexico to wait out the immigration process, even those who are not originally from Mexico. That proposal comes with its own problems. Though United States law appears to allow it, Mexico\u2019s laws do not, if the immigrant is not a Mexican citizen. Two decades ago, Congress passed a law allowing the government to quickly deport undocumented immigrants who have not been in the United States very long, without allowing them go before a judge. In practice, the government has used this process, called \u201cexpedited removal,\u201d relatively narrowly because of concerns about whether it violates constitutional rights of due process that are granted to anyone in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Since 2002, expedited removal has been applied only to immigrants who have been in the country less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border. That is because the Supreme Court has held that such immigrants can still be considered \u201cin transit\u201d and not here long enough to qualify for due process protections. The Trump administration is now planning to use expedited removal as extensively as the original law allows, saying that limits on its use had contributed to a backlog of more than half a million cases in immigration court. Immigration advocates vowed to challenge the change. \u201cSomeone could be living in Chicago for a year and a half and then be swept off the street by an ICE agent,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A. C. L. U.\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. \u201cHe is going to be detained and removed right away without ever seeing a judge. \u201d One of the memos on Tuesday acknowledges that children who arrive at the border alone  \u2014   \u201cunaccompanied alien children,\u201d in government parlance  \u2014   are entitled to special protections: Unlike other border crossers, whom border patrol agents may deport without a legal hearing, these children must appear before an immigration judge and be interviewed by an asylum officer. Children have surged across the border in recent years, many fleeing violence and destitution in Central America. But the memo turns a sterner face to their parents, who, under the new policy, may be subject to deportation or even prosecution for enabling their children to come into the country. The memo notes that parents and relatives often pay smugglers several thousand dollars to bring their children from Central America, an act that the memo says amounts to facilitating illegal smuggling or trafficking. Immigration advocates are predicting that the policy will drive parents of migrant children further underground. With parents fearful of prosecution, advocates say, navigating the immigration process  \u2014   or even showing up to court  \u2014   could become much harder for these children. Some 750, 000 people who were brought into the country as children were issued work permits and temporary protection from deportation under an Obama program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Even President Trump said last week that the subject \u201cis very, very difficult\u201d for him and that he promised to \u201cdeal with DACA with heart. \u201d So far, the Trump administration has left the program alone. But chills went through the community of \u201cDreamers,\u201d as DACA recipients are known, with the recent arrest of a    Mexican immigrant in Washington State, Daniel Ramirez. Immigration agents arrested him when they went to his house to detain his father, a convicted drug trafficker. They said Mr. Ramirez admitted to having gang affiliations, which cancels the protection offered under DACA. But Mr. Ramirez denies having made the admission, and his lawyers are fighting his deportation. A program known as 287( g) named for its section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows the Department of Homeland Security to train local and state law enforcement officers to work as de facto federal immigration officers, identifying undocumented immigrants in their communities and jails and turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. From 2006 to 2013, the program led to 175, 000 deportations, according to federal statistics. But investigations and court rulings revealed an ugly side effect: In some jurisdictions, local officers were using their authority to racially profile Latinos. One of the most egregious cases was in Maricopa County, Arizona\u2019s most populous, during the tenure of Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, who a federal judge ruled had discriminated against Latinos in patrols and other enforcement efforts. The Obama administration curtailed the use of the program, which currently involves 32 agencies in 16 states. The Trump administration wants more agencies to take part, and some have already expressed a desire to do so. The administration is trying to significantly expand the amount of information available on the enforcement of immigration laws and, in particular, unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will establish a new office to work with the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom appeared with Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. The office, known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice, will provide victims with information about defendants\u2019 immigration status and whether they are in jail. Significantly, funding for the office comes from reallocating \u201cany and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens\u201d by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE will now have to provide monthly public reports on its apprehensions and releases. The agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails. That is a clear shot across the bow at   sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, contending that turning in unauthorized immigrants would destroy the fragile relationship that the police have with immigrant communities. \u201cWe are going to continue our policy that has been in place because we think that it helps us have a safer, stronger, better community,\u201d Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse said on Tuesday. The Trump administration is already pondering ways to punish those cities by denying them some federal aid. \u201cNow everyone is going to be able to see how many criminal aliens are being released as a result of the sanctuary policies,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration. In January 2009, the departing Bush administration extended some Privacy Act rights, which American citizens and legal permanent residents already had, to undocumented immigrants. That meant that information obtained by one agency, like the Internal Revenue Service or Citizenship and Immigration Services, could not generally be shared with other agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One rationale for the move was to protect the personal information of immigrants who might one day become citizens covered by the Privacy Act. The Trump administration has now rescinded those privacy protections. One of the memos released on Tuesday said that those protections had been detrimental to the families of the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, because those families could not get information about such defendants\u2019 legal status, or whether they had been deported, leaving victims \u201cfeeling marginalized and without a voice. \u201d The Department of Homeland Security said it would develop new rules on the sharing of undocumented immigrants\u2019 private information. But advocates for unauthorized immigrants said they feared that immigrants who had applied for legal status  \u2014   in the process divulging they were not here legally  \u2014   were now in danger of having that information used to deport them. \u201cThe constitution doesn\u2019t traditionally allow bait and switches,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an organization that advocates for immigrants. \u201cThese are folks who submitted their information attempting to play by the rules, with part of the rules being that the government would protect their privacy. \u201d The memos released on Tuesday repeat Mr. Trump\u2019s demand in his executive order for a larger enforcement force that can speed up the removal of millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States. In practice, that may play out more slowly than the president might prefer. The source of this caution is none other than John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, who told lawmakers this month that he did not believe it would be possible to hire the desired 15, 000 ICE and border patrol agents in the next couple of years. \u201cI\u2019d rather have fewer and make sure that they\u2019re   people,\u201d Mr. Kelly told lawmakers. \u201cI will not skimp on the training and the standards. \u201d On top of the stringent hiring standards and training, Border Patrol applicants are required to take a polygraph test, which nearly 60 percent fail. A previous surge in hiring under President George W. Bush resulted in dozens of corruption cases, with Border Patrol and other agents accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Mary Tyler Moore Is Mourned by Dick Van Dyke and Other Stars - The New York Times", "author": "Niraj Chokshi and Liam Stack", "text": "Mary Tyler Moore, whose iconic television roles reflected the changing place of women in   America, died on Wednesday, eliciting an outpouring of tributes on social media.

So on Monday, conservatives around the country got out the Make America Great Again hats, unfurled American flags and held rallies at state capitols and on courthouse steps, seeking to rekindle the populist fervor that helped vault Mr. Trump to the White House and stick up for a president whose approval ratings have taken a beating during five   weeks in office. But the modest crowds that showed up for the noontime rallies from New Jersey to Georgia to Colorado offered a reminder of what liberal groups learned eight years ago in the face of Tea Party anger at President Barack Obama: Stoking   energy is often easier for the outraged resistance than for the party pulling the levers in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of comments from the leftists about, \u2018Your crowd\u2019s not going to be as big as our crowd,\u2019\u201d said Betty Blanco, a retired teacher from La Junta, Colo. on the state\u2019s conservative eastern plains, who organized a rally on the steps of the   State Capitol. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a contest. \u201d About 150 Trump supporters turned out for Monday\u2019s rally in Denver, held just across the street from a park that had swelled with tens of thousands of protesters as part of the Women\u2019s March on Jan. 21. Organizers said Monday\u2019s rallies, held a day before the president addresses a joint session of Congress, bubbled up organically from Trump supporters who felt he was being treated unfairly by Democrats and the news media. Some people said the ferocity of that criticism had actually nudged them closer to Mr. Trump. \u201cI was mad at Trump for a while, absolutely,\u201d said Steve Foose, a bus driver in Middletown, N. J. and   former Democrat who joined about 200 people waving signs and flags along the curb of a   crossroads. \u201cI just grew to like him, and I would lay down my life for him. \u201d Monday\u2019s rallies were filled with prayer, choruses of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and speeches about cutting taxes and regulations. People applauded the president and veterans, and urged one another to stay positive. But there were also chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d every so often, and a few shouting matches when Trump critics wandered by and yelled at the crowds. People praised Mr. Trump for actions that have provoked protests and lawsuits from the left. In interviews at five rallies on Monday, his supporters said that he was breaking the china in Washington, cracking down on immigration and supporting American businesses, and that they were getting frustrated that more people did not seem to see it that way. In Atlanta, Jermane Enoch, 57, a project manager from Powder Springs, Ga. was among the few   in a largely white crowd of 200 who rallied on the president\u2019s behalf at Liberty Plaza, in the shadow of the State Capitol. Wearing a red Trump hat, a patriotic bow tie and a Trump   Mr. Enoch said that good businesspeople would understand why Monday\u2019s rallies across the country were needed, given what he said was the \u201cnegative messaging\u201d from   protesters and the news media. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to have a show of continuous support, just like it\u2019s necessary for businesses to show continuous improvement,\u201d he said. Mr. Enoch argued that the president had been mischaracterized and misunderstood. The idea that Mr. Trump is a racist, as some critics contend, struck him as balderdash. In a   turn at the microphone, Mr. Enoch said his support for Mr. Trump superseded race, and he urged a return to conservative values. Mr. Enoch brandished a pocket Constitution, to much applause. And he took a cue from Isaiah as he said Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters should not be cowed by counterprotest: \u201cI am not afraid!\u201d he said. \u201cNo weapon that is formed against us shall prosper!\u201d RICHARD FAUSSET In Mandeville, a city in one of Louisiana\u2019s most conservative parishes, there was some question as to how many Trump supporters would materialize, this being the usually quiet eve of Mardi Gras. But there was little doubt that those who showed up  \u2014   150 or so bikers, retirees,   police officers and others  \u2014   would be   in their support for a president who won the parish by roughly three to one. A home remodeler and disc jockey who uses the name Bobby Blaze made the most   entrance, wearing a suit over his leather \u201cBrotherhood of Bikers\u201d vest, a bright red tie with a gold clip and, to top it all off, a   Trump wig. He said that his father, a World War II veteran who died two years ago, would have loved Mr. Trump: \u201c\u2018The country needs John Wayne,\u2019 that\u2019s what he used to say. \u201d And after aiding its allies around the globe for decades, Mr. Blaze suggested, the United States had finally gotten such a   leader at a time when it needed him most. \u201cWe can\u2019t help the world,\u201d he said, \u201ctill we can help ourselves first. \u201d CAMPBELL ROBERTSON In Cabarrus County, N. C. which Mr. Trump easily carried, more than 150 of his supporters met up outside the courthouse in Concord, many of them unfurling last year\u2019s Trump campaign flags, lawn signs and red caps  \u2014   though a surprising number said they had never attended a Trump rally during the presidential race. Bill Cagle, a retiree, decided to attend on Monday after seeing a deluge of news coverage of   demonstrations in the streets and at congressional town halls. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve been silent long enough, and we\u2019ve really got to say what\u2019s in the heart,\u2019 when I saw all of this vitriol the last six weeks,\u201d Mr. Cagle said. An operations manager for a company that builds towers for   lines, Mr. Cagle said he was a registered Democrat but had not voted for the party\u2019s presidential ticket in decades. He said he maintained his registration only to vote against what he considered the worst option in a primary race. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done in a little bit of time, I think is great,\u201d he said of Mr. Trump, noting in particular his efforts to roll back regulations. \u201cI\u2019ve been in business, and by golly, if they can get rid of some of that, it\u2019s great. \u201d TRIP GABRIEL On the edges of the Denver crowd, two men exemplified the devotion and the dread that the president inspires. Ron Kamstra, a retired civil engineer and   Christian who said he deeply supported Mr. Trump\u2019s stances on terrorism and immigration, handed out photocopied passages of the Quran that he said encouraged violence. Mohamed Mashkooke, an accountant born in Somalia, wandered up to Mr. Kamstra and said he was growing increasingly worried about becoming the target of racist attacks  \u2014   like the shooting last week of two Indian men in Kansas. Cordially at first, but then increasingly tensely, the men argued about religion, immigration, faith and the validity of Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate. (Despite all of the facts, Mr. Kamstra is still dubious.) \u201cI don\u2019t hate Trump,\u201d Mr. Mashkooke said finally, walking away, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s crazy. \u201d \u201cO.

At every Q. and A. session for the movie, people would ask the same question: \u201cIf I want to be a comedian [or actor or writer or improviser or film director] how do I get started?\u201d The truth is they should probably pick someone more successful to ask  \u2014   I make small films, small   shows Off Broadway and small comedy specials for Netflix  \u2014   but I\u2019m the person who showed up to talk to them. And now I\u2019m the person offering you unsolicited advice  \u2014   so if you don\u2019t need it or want it, this is not for you. Anyway, I\u2019ve boiled my answer down to six ideas. 1. DON\u2019T WAIT Write. Make a short film. Go to an open mike. Take an improv class. There\u2019s no substitute for actually doing something. Don\u2019t talk about it anymore. Maybe don\u2019t even finish reading this essay. 2. FAIL Don\u2019t worry about failing. There\u2019s a great video where Ira Glass explains that when you start in a new field, your work won\u2019t be as good as your taste. It will take years for your taste and the quality of your work to intersect. (If ever!) Failure is essential. There\u2019s no substitute for it. It\u2019s not just encouraged but required. The bedrock of all good pieces of writing is 10 bad drafts. Maybe 20. I wrote 12 drafts of \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d 14 drafts of my first movie, \u201cSleepwalk With Me,\u201d and worked on my first   show for six years. My first   set on \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d in 2002 was mined from three hours of   material that I had tried and failed with for six years. 3. LEARN FROM THE FAILURE This is where it becomes important to find a community of people you respect. People who have good taste. People who might not be good at something themselves but know what good is. They might be in a theater company, at an improv school, or live in your dorm. They aren\u2019t the easiest thing to find. When I was in college, every Wednesday I drove my girlfriend Maggie\u2019s Ford Taurus to an open mike at a Best Western 40 minutes away, to enter a lottery of 30 comedians trying to win one of the nine spots to perform in front of the other angry 21 comedians. It sucked. People didn\u2019t like my comedy there. I didn\u2019t love theirs. It wasn\u2019t a fit. But then I got a job working as a door person at the DC Improv comedy club in Washington, and that was a fit. Around the same time, I was cast in my college improv group. So all at once, I met people whom I could bounce jokes and ideas off of. They\u2019d give me candid feedback, and I tried to listen. I wasn\u2019t great at it at first. It\u2019s hard to hear criticism. But I\u2019ve learned that harsh feedback, constructive feedback, even weird, random feedback, is all helpful, if you know the essence of what you\u2019re trying to convey. I once heard an interview where Ron Howard said that he tests the rough cuts of his movies with a ton of audiences. He doesn\u2019t do it to be told what the movie\u2019s vision should be, but to understand whether his vision is coming across. If not, he makes changes. Your vision is not being conveyed a majority of the time. With \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d I workshopped the script like the way I workshop my standup: I invited friends over to read it out loud in my living room and then fed them pizza. The pizza was excellent. The script often wasn\u2019t. So I\u2019d get my friends all drunk on pizza and then ask them hard questions like: \u201cWhat do you like least about the script? Be honest. I can take it. \u201d That\u2019s where I learned the most. 4. MAYBE QUIT You might not be meant to be a writer or performer or improviser. You might be meant to teach kids math or raise money for a food bank or start a company that makes Rubik\u2019s Cubes for babies. Don\u2019t rule out quitting. There is going to be an insane amount of work ahead, and your time might be spent better elsewhere. There was a great column in The New York Times recently where Angela Duckworth writes, \u201cRather than ask, \u2018What do I want to be when I grow up?\u2019 ask, \u2018In what way do I wish the world were different? What problem can I help solve?\u2019 This puts the focus where it should be  \u2014   on how you can serve other people. \u201d 5. BE BOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE STUFF THAT\u2019S SMALL BUT GREAT Eight years ago, I made a network sitcom pilot based on my life. It was a dream come true. A sitcom about my life? What could be better than that for a standup comedian? Well, it didn\u2019t get picked up. I was devastated. But here\u2019s the kicker: Failing to get that sitcom was the single greatest stroke of luck that\u2019s happened in my entire career. The show wasn\u2019t truly my comedic voice. It was watered down by network and studio notes to the point of being like dozens of other bland sitcoms. After that, I no longer wanted to create projects for the Hollywood gatekeepers. The networks. The studios. Since then, I\u2019ve created a handful of pieces for \u201cThis American Life,\u201d   three Off Broadway   shows, toured hundreds of cities around the world, and written, directed and starred in two feature films. All outside the system. Based on that work, I\u2019ve been offered small movie roles by people who work inside the system. Which is to say: Leaving the system behind and creating something of your own may actually be thing that gets you into the system, hopefully on your own terms. The point is, forget the gatekeepers. As far as I\u2019m concerned, what you create in a       improv theater in Phoenix can be far more meaningful than a mediocre sitcom being   by seven million people. America doesn\u2019t need more stuff. We need more great stuff. You could make that. 6. CLEVERNESS IS OVERRATED, AND HEART IS UNDERRATED Plus, there are fewer people competing for heart, so you have a better chance of getting noticed. Sometimes people say, \u201cOne thing you have to offer in your work is yourself. \u201d I disagree. I think it\u2019s the only thing.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Investment Strategist Forecasts Collapse Timeline: \u2018The Last Gasp Of This Economic Cycle Will Come In 2018\u2019", "author": "Mac Slavo", "text": "It is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the U.S. economy will collapse. That, according to a host of experts, both mainstream and alternative, is a given. \nThe only question now is \u201cwhen\u201d that moment will come. \nAccording to Christine Hughes, chief investment strategist at Otterwood Capital , it will be very soon. Basing her assessment on historically dead-on yield curve analysis, Hughes says in her latest update to clients that we\u2019re looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020, but that some time in the next 12 \u2013 15 months is the more likely scenario, which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018 . \nFirst, the chart, which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months: \nHughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning: \nAs the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it [the yield curve] collapses. So let\u2019s assume we\u2019re like every other time in history and that happens. Then it moves forward to 2018\u2026 \nSo, 2018, according to the yield curve, is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle. We\u2019re closing in on 2016 now\u2026 we basically have a year\u2026 maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands. \nSo if you are levered personally or corporately\u2026 if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuff\u2026 the Canadian housing market comes to mind\u2026 You might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself. \nWatch the video report: \nWolf Richter of Wolf Street explains why the Treasury Yield Curve is so important: \nSince early July, the 30-year US Treasury Bond Price Index has plunged 8.3%. It\u2019s now called \u201cthe rout\u201d in longer-dated government bonds. One of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultra-low yields. \nWhat has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades? The US Treasury yield curve. It drives bank lending \u2013 which can strangle the economy. But this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. \nWe know it is only a matter of time at this point. \nGreg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to Mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences: \nSo, when the debt bubble bursts we\u2019re going to get a correction in population. It\u2019s a mathematical certainty. \nMillions upon millions of people are going to die on a world-wide scale when the debt bubble bursts. And I\u2019m saying when not if\u2026 \n\u2026 \nWhen resources become more and more scarce we\u2019re going to see countries at war with each other.

The ruling effectively dissolved the elected legislature, which is led by Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents, and allows the court to write laws itself, experts said. The move caps a year in which the last vestiges of Venezuela\u2019s democracy have been torn down, critics and regional leaders say, leaving what many now describe as not just an authoritarian regime, but an outright dictatorship. \u201cWhat we have warned of has finally come to pass,\u201d said Luis Almagro, the head of the Organization of American States, a regional diplomacy group that includes Venezuela and is investigating the country for violating the bloc\u2019s Democratic Charter. Mr. Almagro called the move a \u201c  coup,\u201d a term used in Latin America to denote takeovers typical of the 1990s in Guatemala and Peru  \u2014   but virtually   in the region today. Recent months have seen a swift consolidation of power by Mr. Maduro as scores of political prisoners have been detained without trial, protesters violently repressed and local elections postponed. In taking power from the National Assembly, the ruling removed what most consider to be the only remaining counterbalance to the president\u2019s growing power in the country. The court said that lawmakers were \u201cin a situation of contempt,\u201d and that while that lasted, the justices themselves would step in to \u201censure that parliamentary powers were exercised directly by this chamber, or by the body that the chamber chooses. \u201d It did not say whether it might hand power back. Members of the National Assembly denounced the ruling on Thursday. \u201cThey have kidnapped the Constitution, they have kidnapped our rights, they have kidnapped our liberty,\u201d said Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the body, holding a crumpled copy of the ruling before reporters on Thursday. Oneida Guaipe, an opposition lawmaker from the country\u2019s central coast, said the body would continue to do its work, even if its laws would now be ignored when it produced legislation. \u201cThis is demonstrating before the world the authoritarianism here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people chose us through a popular vote. \u201d The ruling was also a challenge to Venezuela\u2019s neighbors, which met in Washington this week to put pressure on the country to hold elections, and to discuss a possible expulsion of Venezuela from the O. A. S. on the grounds that the country is not democratic. Last week, the United States, Canada and a dozen of Latin America\u2019s largest nations called for Mr. Maduro to recognize the National Assembly\u2019s powers, a rare joint statement that reflected deep impatience with his government. \u201cWe consider it a serious setback for democracy in Venezuela,\u201d the United States State Department said on Thursday of the court decision. Peru withdrew its ambassador in protest. David Smilde, an analyst from the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group, said it might now be up to Venezuela\u2019s neighbors to encourage the country to hold elections again, given resistance from within the government. \u201cThe Maduro government seems to have no intention of respecting the basic elements of electoral democracy,\u201d he said. Critics say a long litany of other moves by the government are taking a toll on Venezuela\u2019s democracy. Perhaps most visible to Venezuelans was an effort last year to hold a recall referendum against the president, whose popularity is sinking along with the country\u2019s collapsing economy. While such a referendum was permitted by the country\u2019s Constitution, and highly favored in polls, Mr. Maduro alternatively called the effort illegal or a coup staged by his opponents. In October, a lower court suspended the process on the grounds that there had been irregularities in the gathering of signatures. Meanwhile, political prisoners continued to be arrested. In January, Mr. Maduro established a new \u201c  commando\u201d to round up political dissidents accused of treason. The group has taken aim at members of the opposition, arresting many, including a city councilman from central Venezuela and a deputy lawmaker in the National Assembly. In February, after CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, the network\u2019s Spanish language channel, broadcast an investigation that linked Venezuela\u2019s vice president to a passport fraud scheme in the Middle East, Mr. Maduro ordered the channel off the air. The government has blocked the Caracas bureau chief of The New York Times from entering the country since October. But to many, the gradual assault against the National Assembly, more than a year in the making, was the most telling sign of democratic erosion in Venezuela. \u201cIt has come in fragments,\u201d Carlos Ayala Corao, a Venezuelan lawyer and legal analyst, said of the court\u2019s actions against the legislature. \u201cThey have been slicing it in pieces. \u201d The conflicts began in December 2015, when rising grievances about the country\u2019s faltering economy propelled Mr. Maduro\u2019s opposition to win control of the legislature. It was the first time in years that the chamber was not dominated by the movement founded by the former leftist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Mr. Maduro initially said he accepted the vote. He even appeared before opposition lawmakers to give his annual address on the state of the government in January of last year. But the Supreme Court, packed with loyalists to Mr. Maduro shortly before the National Assembly took power, was chipping away at the chamber\u2019s powers. It refused to let it seat four lawmakers on the grounds that there had been voting irregularities. That denied the opposition of a supermajority, which would have given it expanded powers over Mr. Maduro. The National Assembly went back and forth on the ruling, but eventually complied. As the National Assembly began to get to work, it continued to clash with the court. By last spring, the legislature had written laws delivering on campaign promises like one measure to invigorate the economy and another to free more than 100 political prisoners, only to see the court overturn them as unconstitutional. When Mr. Maduro tried to increase his own powers under a state of emergency that he declared, the legislature rejected the effort. But the court sided with the president. In October, the court stripped the National Assembly of its power to review the annual budget, leaving Mr. Maduro in charge of the country\u2019s purse strings. More recently, legislators tried to block the president from pursuing oil ventures without their approval. In Wednesday\u2019s ruling stripping the National Assembly of its lawmaking powers, the court said the president had the right to make these oil deals. It said its ruling was justified by the Assembly\u2019s choice to keep the lawmakers onboard whose elections had been questioned earlier. This act, it said, rendered the Assembly itself invalid. With few protesters in the streets of Caracas on Thursday, it was unclear what popular support the opposition might get from the public. Analysts say many Venezuelans feel as dispirited by the opposition as by leftist leaders, given the opposition\u2019s continued defeat by the government. Opposition leaders called for protests on Saturday and in the coming week but have been unable to draw large crowds since last fall. John Magdaleno, a political consultant, said he expected a wider crackdown against the opposition from Mr. Maduro in coming weeks, and possibly more arrests. \u201cIn my opinion, from now on, there will be growing pressures against lawmakers,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s probable there will be much greater persecution of political leaders. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Whether it's John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run 'War on Women' tactic to destroy the Republican candidate", "author": "Natural News Editors", "text": "Whether it's John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run 'War on Women' tactic to destroy the Republican candidate \n  Natural News Editors Tags: war on women , democrats , campaign tactic (NaturalNews) Single women are a crucial element of the Democrat constituency, pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasn't so effective in election after election. We may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a \"War on Women.\"(Article written by John Howard, republished from Breitbart.com )Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of \"Strange New Respect\" for Romney this year. Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism \u2014 and don't be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate isn't as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016.We should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the Left's revised opinion of Romney to good use. What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. They've wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means they're tacitly admitting Barack Obama didn't know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn't care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an out-of-touch Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about \"binders full of women ,\" and now they can't quite remember what they were going on about.As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stay-at-home motherhood. When a mild backlash ensued, the White House memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name. [1, 2]In the Democrat imagination and campaign ads, Republicans are constantly targeting American woman. You can draw a straight line from Anita Hill's hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to \"journalist\" George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.It's all pure opportunism, not principle. Romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. Trump's policies include a family-leave plan, a culture-war cease-fire declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with late-term abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. There's precious little that could be twisted into a War on Women narrative, even by the people who used Sandra Fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. Therefore, the Left ignores Trump's policies and hits his character, while Bill Freakin' Clinton gets ready to move back into the White House.In the Nineties, Democrats argued that Clinton's sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to MoveOn.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. Liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion Bill Clinton's libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. He was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.Partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. Women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. They can only achieve personal \"independence\" through total dependence on the Big Government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in America who supposedly aren't looking to exploit them. (You're not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers.) [3]The great left-wing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled America with devastating social problems, but that's not a problem for the social engineers. Indeed, it's more of a feature than a bug.Everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form non-government voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.The dirty little secret known to the Left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of child-rearing.So in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the \"implicit bias\" of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.Read more at: Breitbart.com", "label": "1"}, {"title": "Breitbart News Daily: Trump Boom - Breitbart", "author": "Breitbart News", "text": "On the Thursday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart    Alex Marlow will continue our discussion of President Trump\u2019s first 100 days.

S. military prison in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, before incoming    Donald Trump takes over on January 20, the White House press secretary reiterated on Thursday. [That same day, reports confirmed that the U. S. transferred four detainees to Saudi Arabia.  The Daily Mail has placed the number of 11th hour transfers at 22, including the four recently sent to Saudi Arabia, adding that the group of prisoners who are expected to be released will include jihadists who have threatened to behead and bomb Americans. Prior to the Daily Mail article and recent transfers, the number of prisoners who are expected to be set free by the time Obama leaves the White House varied by news agencies, ranging from 17 to 19, a move that would reduce the current detainee population at the Guant\u00e1namo facility to between 40 and 42. On Thursday, Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters: I am not able to speak to any specific detainee transfers between now and January 20th other than to confirm for you that there are likely to be some.  And whenever those transfers take place, once they have been completed, we announce them publicly.  And that will continue to be our approach through January 20th.  And my expectation is that there will be some additional announcements of that type. Asked about the risk of detainees   in terrorist activity against the United States, Earnest boasted that only nine of the prisoners transferred since Obama took office have been confirmed by the intelligence community as having returned to militant activity, compared to 21 percent (113 of 532) under the previous administration, a figure often touted by Democrats. However, Earnest failed to mention that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) figure (nine) that he highlights refers to   as of July 2016, when 161 detainees had been released by Obama, not the 183 he mentioned on Thursday. The nine confirmed   includes one deceased detainee and accounts for six percent of the 161 prisoners who had been released under Obama as of July 2016. Moreover, the number of prisoners released before 2009 exceeds those liberated under Obama more than   (3. 3) which may account for the higher rate of confirmed   under George W. Bush. The White House spokesman attributed the low percentage of   under Obama to the president\u2019s     panel, known as the Periodic Review Board (PRB) that has cleared for release all the prisoners transferred out after 2009, including   \u201cforever prisoners,\u201d or those believed to be too dangerous to release. \u201cSince President Obama took office, and since these reforms were initiated, nine detainees have been confirmed by the intelligence community of reengaging in the fight,\u201d Earnest said on Thursday. \u201cConsidering that we have released 183 detainees during President Obama\u2019s time in office, a little     math would indicate that our percentage is much better, and it\u2019s a result of the reforms that President Obama instituted on his first day in office. \u201d According to ODNI, 20 out of 161 detainees (12 percent) had been confirmed (nine) or suspected (11) to have returned to terrorist activities under Obama\u2019s watch as of July 2016. Under the Bush administration, 188 out of 532 (35 percent) are confirmed (113) or suspected (75) to have   in terrorism. When taken as a whole, if there were 20 detainees confirmed or suspected to have   in terrorism for every 161 detainees released under Bush like during the Obama administration, the overall rate of terror returnees before 2009 would be closer to 40 percent, not 35. In late December, the Chicago Tribune, citing U. S. officials, reported that the Obama administration has shared its plans with Congress to transfer out as many as 19 detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Of the 55 prisoners still held at Gitmo, 18 have been cleared for release by Obama\u2019s PRB and more than half (27) are considered \u201cforever prisoners,\u201d or too dangerous to release. Nevertheless, Obama has already released prisoners who had been designated too dangerous to release. The remaining 10 prisoners are believed to still be undergoing war crimes proceedings at military commissions, including at least six who were facing death penalty tribunals as of late last year. On Friday, the Pentagon announced that four detainees  \u2014   Salem Ahmad Hadi Bin Kanad, Muhammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanim, Abdallah Yahya Yusif   and Muhammad Ali Abdallah Muhammad Bwazir  \u2014   had been transferred to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All four detainees are from   Yemen, which shares a border with Saudi Arabia. At least two individuals  \u2014   Kanad and Ghanim  \u2014   had been linked to the Taliban when they were apprehended and taken to the Guant\u00e1namo prison, also known as Gitmo. Meanwhile, the    Bwazir has been directly linked to Osama bin Laden.   also affiliated with   was born in Saudi Arabia, but is a citizen of Yemen, according to the U. S. military.

The number of those rumored to be potential Democratic candidates for the 2020 election pales in comparison to the list of people who have filed to run for president so   129 people have filed to run for the presidency in 2020.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Migrants Confront Judgment Day Over Old Deportation Orders - The New York Times", "author": "Vivian Yee", "text": "There are a little more than two weeks between Juan, an electrician in the Bronx, and the date he cannot forget: March 21, 2017, at 8 a. m. when the federal government has told him to report for deportation. Two weeks to decide: Avoid it, and try to preserve the American life he has built for a little longer, even as a fugitive. Go, and lose it all: his wife and son, his job, his apartment, his world. \u201cI would feel like an animal if I stay here and hide,\u201d said Juan, 29, who asked that his last name not be used. \u201cI want to prove that I can follow the laws. I want to make my case at this meeting, but I know that if I go, they\u2019re going to deport me. \u201d In an immigration system mottled with escape hatches and hobbled by scant resources, Juan, who fled Colombia six years ago, is one of nearly a million people who have managed to linger in the United States despite having been ordered out of the country by an immigration judge  \u2014   some of them more than a decade ago. And with the Trump administration intent on sweeping perhaps millions of immigrants without legal status out of the country, the White House has not had to look far to make a quick mark. Because people with deportation orders have had their day in court, most of them can be sent out of the country without seeing a judge, sometimes within hours of being arrested. \u201cPeople who have been ordered deported and who are still here are the   fruit,\u201d said Stephen   an immigration law professor at Cornell University. \u201cTrump has said he has wanted to deport more people. The easiest way to get those numbers up are to take those people who\u2019ve been ordered deported and go after them. \u201d President Trump\u2019s immigration agency has already offered what looks like a preview: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recently deported to Mexico an Arizona  mother who had been ordered out of the country four years ago. But the   will be complicated. The backlog of what the government calls \u201cfugitive aliens\u201d has persisted through Republican and Democratic administrations, inflamed conservatives who oppose illegal immigration, and resisted the immigration authorities\u2019 attempts at enforcement. Since 2006, even as the overall total of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has dipped, the number facing outstanding deportation orders has grown by more than half, to around 962, 000 people from 632, 726. More than half of them come from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. (Another 13, 200 or so, as of early February, were already in the custody of customs officials.) Despite the Bush and Obama administrations\u2019   commitments to focus on expelling those who pose a serious danger to their communities, slightly less than one in five people facing deportation has been convicted of a crime in the United States. The causes for delays can vary. Deportations have been deferred for humanitarian reasons  \u2014   like allowing mothers to stay with sick children in the United States  \u2014   or they have been frozen while an appeal is mounted. The Obama administration put off deportations for thousands of immigrants it did not consider priorities, including Juan, the Bronx electrician, and Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de Rayos, the Arizona mother, often   people with strong ties to their communities. \u201cFelons, not families criminals, not children,\u201d President Barack Obama said in 2014, describing the kinds of people he wanted deported. The government also postponed deportations for people who were likely to face torture if they were sent back. Some deportations are simply impossible to carry out: About a quarter of the immigrants with outstanding deportation orders come from countries that refuse to take back deportees, including China, Haiti, Brazil and India. Mr. Trump has threatened to stop issuing visas to people from these countries. In the past, diplomats have urged caution on this front, not wanting to disrupt international relationships over the issue of deportees. And many people under final orders have slipped through gaping cracks in the immigration system. Court notices  \u2014   either mailed to outdated addresses or illegible to Spanish speakers  \u2014   are routinely missed, leaving judges to issue deportation orders for people who miss their chance to argue their case. Nearly a quarter of judges\u2019 decisions rendered in 2015, for example, involved cases where the immigrant in question was absent. The months and, sometimes, years it takes for immigration and asylum cases to wind through a clogged court system can cause the authorities to lose track of immigrants living and working in the country, because they have fled or simply moved. The White House has sought to make it harder for immigrants to be remain free inside the United States while their requests for asylum plod through the courts. They will be detained more often, or asked to wait in Mexico until a judge can rule. \u201cThere are all kinds of things in the system that weren\u2019t built to maximize compliance,\u201d said David A. Martin, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and a former immigration official in the Obama and Clinton administrations. It led to a climate, he said, that has prompted many people to not consider a deportation order a serious matter. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the attitudes that sometimes infuriates, with some justification, people who voted for Donald Trump. \u201d In a significant break from his predecessor, Mr. Trump is directing immigration agents to go after virtually anyone who is in the United States illegally, ending the reprieve for people who had not been considered priorities. \u201cEnsure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed,\u201d one line of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration reads, with the crispness of a traffic sign. \u201cWhat has been lacking, up until a month ago, is a willingness and a commitment on the part of the administration to actually do it,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter immigration controls. \u201cNothing is easy,\u201d he said, but going after people who already have deportation orders \u201cwill be the easiest part of enforcing the president\u2019s removal priorities. \u201d President George W. Bush\u2019s administration dented the backlog by deploying fugitive teams that were supposed to track down unauthorized immigrants with deportation orders and criminal records. But the strategy drew a backlash when the raids began snaring undocumented immigrants who were not targets. \u201cThat was something that caused a lot of controversy and a lot of anxiety in immigrant communities, because it meant these officers could stop anyone at any time,\u201d said Randy Capps, the director of research at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Mr. Capps added that while the Obama administration narrowed the scope of such raids, he expected the Trump administration to return to the Bush model. There is, of course, an easier way to find some people with final orders: Wait for them to walk into ICE offices for their scheduled appointments. Ms. Rayos was driven across the border within hours of her   in Phoenix, and her deportation has haunted immigrants with coming appointments ever since. But the Trump administration has yet to show a consistent hand. Roxana Orellana Santos, 37, was allowed to walk out of her appointment in Baltimore last week. Ms. Santos, who said she had fled domestic abuse in El Salvador, was arrested in 2008 while eating lunch outdoors, her lawyers say, leading to a civil rights lawsuit that claimed she had been racially profiled. She had been ordered deported two years before that arrest, after she missed an immigration court hearing. Her lawyers said she could not read the notice, which was in English. Ms. Santos\u2019s next appointment is in August. \u201cI don\u2019t feel assured of what the outcome\u2019s going to be next time,\u201d she said, adding that she had asked her brother to help her husband care for her four children if she was deported. In the case of Juan, the electrician, nothing remains to stop the government from acting on the deportation order he first received in 2013. Juan had requested asylum after paramilitary forces in Colombia tried to kill him, he said, but he lost his final appeal the month Mr. Trump was elected president. \u201cI feel hopeless,\u201d Juan said. \u201cMy wife is here, my son is here, they are my world. I have nowhere else to run to. I\u2019ve run out of options. I don\u2019t know what to do. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "M.I.T., N.Y.U. and Yale Are Sued Over Retirement Plan Fees - The New York Times", "author": "Tara Siegel Bernard", "text": "Three prominent universities were sued on Tuesday, accused of allowing their employees to be charged excessive fees on their retirement savings. The universities  \u2014   the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and Yale  \u2014   each have retirement plans holding more than $3 billion in assets and are being individually sued by a number of their employees in cases seeking   status. The lawyer representing the three groups of plaintiffs, Jerome J. Schlichter, is a pioneer in retirement plan litigation. Over the last decade, he has filed more than 20 lawsuits on behalf of workers in 401( k) retirement plans and has been widely credited with lowering plan fees across corporate America. With the suits filed in federal courts on Tuesday, the focus has turned to a   corner of the retirement savings market, 403( b) plans, which are named for a section of the tax code. The accounts are similar to 401( k) plans, but are offered by public schools and nonprofit institutions like universities and hospitals. The complaints allege that the universities, as the plan sponsors, failed to monitor excessive fees paid to administer the plans and did not replace more expensive,   investments with cheaper ones. Had the plans eliminated their long lists of investment options and used their bargaining power to cut costs, the complaints argue, participants could have collectively saved tens of millions of dollars. \u201cIt is important for retirees and employees of universities to have the same rights and ability to build their retirement assets as employees of   companies,\u201d said Mr. Schlichter, a founding partner of Schlichter Bogard  Denton in St. Louis. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be penalized. \u201d In a statement, New York University said that it took the welfare of its faculty and employees seriously, including a dignified retirement. \u201cThe retirement plans offered to them are chosen and administered carefully and prudently. We will litigate this case vigorously and expect to prevail,\u201d said John Beckman, a university spokesman. A spokeswoman for M. I. T. said it did not comment on pending litigation, while Yale said it was \u201ccautious and careful\u201d in administering its plans and would defend itself vigorously. More attention is being paid to investment costs shouldered by American workers, who are less likely today to have pension plans. With the strong support of the Obama administration, the Labor Department introduced new rules in April to strengthen investor protections, requiring a broader group of financial professionals to act in customers\u2019 best interest when handling their retirement money. The aim is to reduce conflicts of interest and the fees consumers pay. Even modest reductions in costs can have a significant effect on retirees\u2019 savings. An   example from the Labor Department: Paying one percentage point more in fees over a   career  \u2014   say 1. 5 percent instead of 0. 5 percent  \u2014   could leave a worker with 28 percent less at retirement. An account with $25, 000  \u2014   and no further contributions for those 35 years  \u2014   would rise to only $163, 000 instead of $227, 000, at an annual rate of 7 percent. Mr. Schlichter said the three universities\u2019 plans were targeted because more people were asking questions about their retirement accounts and \u201cthese involve clear breaches of the law. \u201d The complaint against N. Y. U.  \u2014   which involves two 403( b) plans covering faculty, research administration and the medical school  \u2014   centers largely on costs. The complaint said that participants were offered too many investment choices (there were more than 100 options for faculty) and that many of them were too expensive. The suit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, singles out several investments, including the TIAA Traditional Annuity, which it said has severe restrictions and penalties for withdrawal, as well as variable annuities that have several layers of fees and have historically underperformed. A spokesman for TIAA said it offered   plans and   investments that provide lifetime income. The suit also argues that even the cheapest funds offered could have been provided for less, given the enormous size and bargaining power of the faculty and medical school plans, which together held $4. 2 billion in assets for more than 24, 000 participants at the end of 2014. The complaint alleges that the university did not use its negotiating powers to select a single   record keeper for administrative tasks such as sending statements to employees. It said it also overpaid for these services for many years. The issues concerning Yale\u2019s 403( b) retirement plan  \u2014   which held nearly $3. 6 billion in assets in the spring of 2014  \u2014   follow a similar pattern: multiple record keepers with excessive fees, costing participants millions of dollars over the last six years too many investments of the same style and the use of   funds instead of identical but   ones. That case was filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut. Yale eventually consolidated to one provider, TIAA, in April 2015, and swapped in some   investments, but the suit claims that the changes did not go far enough to fully protect the interests of its employees. Mr. Schlichter said participants were still burdened with sorting through more than 100 options, many of which were too expensive. The complaints lodged against M. I. T. \u2019s retirement plan (unusually, it is a 401( k) like those used by corporations) are similar but with a twist. The suit alleges that the university, because of its longstanding relationship with nearby Fidelity, did not conduct a thorough search for a plan provider, which might have provided better service for less. The retirement plan offered more than 340 investment options  \u2014   including 180 Fidelity funds  \u2014   until July 2015, when M. I. T. reduced the lineup to 37 options but still retained Fidelity as the record keeper. The complaint said that Fidelity had donated \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d to M. I. T. while Abigail Johnson, Fidelity\u2019s chief executive, has served as a member of M. I. T. \u2019s board of trustees, giving her influence over the institution\u2019s  . Had the plan reduced its options to those on the menu it adopted last year, \u201cparticipants would have saved over $8 million in fees in 2014 alone, and many millions more since 2010,\u201d according to the complaint, filed in Federal District Court in Massachusetts. M. I. T. recognized that the plan structure was inefficient, the filing said, since that was part of the reason it said it made the changes. But even after the overhaul, the suit alleges, investment costs could be further reduced. Fidelity, which noted that it was not a defendant in the case, declined to comment. Mr. Schlichter\u2019s firm has settled about half of his 20 cases over the last 10 years. His first case involving a 403( b) was against Novant Health, a nonprofit hospital system, which settled last year for $32 million. In a landmark case he argued last year before the Supreme Court, the justices, in a unanimous decision, agreed that plan sponsors had a \u201ccontinuing duty to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones. \u201d A series of suits, from Mr. Schlichter\u2019s firm and others, continue to be filed in the corporate world: Several asset managers, including Neuberger Berman and Franklin Resources, among others, have recently been sued for putting their own investments in their employees\u2019 401( k) plans. Some of the more prominent cases against 401( k) plans settled by Mr. Schlichter include a $62 million settlement against Lockheed Martin, $57 million from Boeing and $27. 5 million from Ameriprise, all in 2015. He also settled cases with Cigna, International Paper, Caterpillar, General Dynamics, Bechtel and Kraft. Mr. Schlichter said his firm, which works on a contingency basis, typically collects up to a third of the settlement, while the remainder goes to the plaintiffs and members of the class. He said that his settlements also required employers to make changes to their plans to ensure fees were reasonable in the future.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Technocracy: The Real Reason Why The UN Wants Control Over The Internet", "author": "Activist Post", "text": "By Patrick Wood By its very nature, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit organization exclusively run by Technocrats.

Buy a more   car. But consumers are heading in the opposite direction. They have rekindled their love of bigger cars, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, favoring them over small cars, hybrids and electric vehicles, which are considered crucial to helping slow global warming. So far this year, nearly 75 percent of the people who have traded in a hybrid or electric car to a dealer have replaced it with an   car, an 18 percent jump from 2015, according to Edmunds. com, a car shopping and research site. In 2008, President Obama set a goal of a million electric cars on the road by 2015 in the United States, but the total is now around 442, 000, including   hybrids. This year, electric and hybrid sales have dropped to 2. 4 percent of   purchases. Falling gas prices have made big, heavy cars fashionable again, said Michael Sivak, the director of sustainable worldwide transportation at the University of Michigan\u2019s Transportation Research Institute. In fact, demand for trucks, S. U. V.s and vans has rebounded to historic levels after they dropped sharply in 2008, when gas was $4 a gallon. \u201cPeople have very short memories about the price of gasoline,\u201d Dr. Sivak said. That spells trouble for the environment.     vehicles, including S. U. V.s and pickups as well as cars, account for 16. 2 percent of all greenhouse emissions produced in the United States, Dr. Sivak\u2019s research shows, making them the biggest source of emissions that individuals control. Reducing tailpipe emissions \u201cis perhaps the most important thing Americans can do,\u201d said Andrew Jones, a   of Climate Interactive, a think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the opposite. \u201d The changing consumer patterns are in plain view at swapalease. com, a marketplace for people who want to get out of a car lease by transferring it to someone else. Dozens of hybrids and electric vehicles are available, in some cases languishing without bites from buyers. \u201cNobody is interested,\u201d said Angelo Di Maria, who lives in the Bronx. Several weeks ago, he listed his   \u2019s 2013 Toyota Prius. To spur interest, he added a $1, 500 cash incentive, which sharply cut the monthly lease payment to $283 from $391. Still no buyer. Mr. Di Maria said that his    who works in construction, loved the Prius, but that his company had given him a Ford   pickup. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to drive around in a big tank?\u201d Mr. Di Maria said. \u201cWhen people start to think gas is more affordable, do they really want to pay the premium on the hybrid?\u201d Buyers of electric cars enjoy huge discounts, however, including federal and state rebates, and the opportunity to bypass gas stations altogether. For that reason, Felix Sui, who works in technology in San Diego, loved his BMW electric car. But now that he and his wife are starting a family, he sold the lease on it so he could buy a Volvo S. U. V. \u201cThe XC90,\u201d he clarified. \u201cThe big one. \u201d A preference for big cars is not going to help the country meet the goals outlined in the Paris climate accord, reached in December. To help reach those goals, average fuel economy would need to soar to at least 100 miles per gallon  \u2014   most likely achievable only through widespread adoption of electric and other   cars, according to Ben Haley, a   of Evolved Energy Research, a consulting firm. President Obama has pushed for stronger federal   rules that call for cars to average 40 miles per gallon by 2025, according to the Environmental Protection Agency the current average is 25. 4 miles per gallon. Though electric cars may be somewhat out of favor for now, that may change. Many are hoping that the Tesla could transform Americans\u2019 views on electric cars, much the way the iPhone did with mobile technology. Tesla still carries asterisks  \u2014   it is losing money, and it is not clear if the company can produce what it has promised  \u2014   but it can point to 370, 000 votes of confidence. That is how many people have put down $1, 000 to reserve one of Tesla\u2019s new Model 3 cars, a significantly   version of its luxury models they won\u2019t even be out until late next year. There are hopes, too, for the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, which boasts a range of 200 miles, nearly matching the projected range of the Tesla Model 3. Those would more than double the range of many cars on the market, helping alleviate the \u201crange anxiety\u201d that many consumers feel. When Tesla first let people sign up online in March, and reservations surged to 325, 000 within a week, Dr. John Sterman, a climate expert at M. I. T. was heartened by the prospect of broader interest in   cars. \u201cAll my friends and colleagues were sending me links to the media reports,\u201d he said. \u201c I thought, this is great news. \u201d Years from now, he added, \u201cwe will look at this as a watershed moment. \u201d Others who worry about climate change can sound like boosters for the new car. \u201cTesla is notorious for performance. It can outperform the hottest, most conventional car,\u201d said Albert Ayala, deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, a publicagency that governs air quality. When he gives speeches and is asked how the   market can improve, he points to Tesla and says, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do. \u201d Seconds after preorders for the new Model 3 became available, John Meyer, 21, an entrepreneur in New York, made his reservation. At the time, he was on a flight from Newark to Los Angeles, and worried that he would miss out if the plane\u2019s   went down. He called the car a \u201cgame changer\u201d because it has everything he wants  \u2014   it is cool, beautiful and powerful, he said, as well as being environmentally friendly. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought a Prius before,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would have if it looked like an Audi. \u201d", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Hillary Clinton Builds $150 Million War Chest, Doubling Donald Trump - The New York Times", "author": "Nicholas Confessore and Rachel Shorey", "text": "Donald J. Trump entered the homestretch of the campaign at a pronounced financial disadvantage to Hillary Clinton, according to figures Mr. Trump\u2019s team released on Saturday, and far below the   goal he set for himself earlier in the race. After raising $100 million in partnership with Republican Party organizations in September, Mr. Trump and committees linked to his campaign began October with $75 million in cash on hand. Mrs. Clinton raised $154 million in September and began October with roughly $150 million in the bank, her campaign said, twice as much as Mr. Trump. Many of the Republican Party\u2019s leading contributors have stayed away from his campaign, judging from financial disclosures filed by Mr. Trump and his party on Saturday, signaling his difficulties in persuading party elites to back him. One exception was Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor who spoke in support of Mr. Trump at the Republican convention in July. A person close to Mr. Thiel said on Saturday that the investor was putting $1. 25 million behind Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Still, Mrs. Clinton will have a huge war chest for   advertising and organizing at a time when she has regained her lead in public opinion polls and Mr. Trump is openly feuding with his party and mired in accusations that he groped women. The monthly figure was a record for Mr. Trump and provided evidence of his powerful appeal among   donors: The campaign now estimates that 2. 6 million people have given to his campaign. But it was only a small improvement over his   in July and August, suggesting he might have peaked. Moreover, Mr. Trump has so far not followed through on promises to spend $100 million of his own fortune on the campaign. In September, he contributed $2 million, his usual amount since he became the Republican nominee, leaving him roughly $44 million short of his goal. Mr. Trump also said he would blitz Mrs. Clinton with $100 million in advertising, but he has spent about $32 million, according to two Republican media buyers, although they have reserved substantial additional advertising in swing states. \u201cOur ad spending strategy has not changed,\u201d Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, wrote in an email. \u201cMr. Trump continues to make significant contributions to his campaign. \u201d Mr. Trump is not starved for cash and could still make additional investments in television and turnout to increase his chances on Nov. 8. But his campaign has been marred by disagreements with Republican organizations in some key states. On Saturday, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign cut ties with Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, a pivotal swing state. A Trump aide accused Mr. Borges of publicly undermining Mr. Trump to promote his own ambitions to run for chairman of the Republican National Committee. In a letter to other Ohio Republicans, the aide, Robert Paduchik, said Mr. Borges had spent the past week on a \u201c  media tour with state and national outlets to criticize our party\u2019s nominee. \u201d Still, Mr. Paduchik added that he expected the Ohio Republican Party to keep covering payroll costs that it had been paying on behalf of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Some leading Republican donors have tried an awkward straddle, providing money to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that is focused on attacking Mrs. Clinton but is said to be aiming its fire to achieve maximum benefit for Republican House and Senate candidates endangered by Mr. Trump\u2019s slide. That group, called Future45, received $5 million from the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson in September and the same amount from his wife, Miriam. An additional $2. 3 million came from Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder, and other donors, including the coal magnate Joe Craft. But disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday hinted at fragmentation and disarray among outside groups that support Mr. Trump and have competed with one another for dollars and turf. While Mr. Trump\u2019s sons and advisers have appeared at   for two groups  \u2014   Great America PAC and Rebuilding America Now  \u2014   at least three additional super PACs have organized in apparent support of him. One, called Save America From Its Government, was founded by Andrew Beal, a banker and real estate investor who is a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team. According to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Beal gave $2 million to the group in September, nearly all of the money it reported raising. A fourth group, a committee called American Horizons, was attacked by the Trump campaign this summer for promoting a \u201cDinner With Donald\u201d contest that Mr. Trump had neither authorized nor agreed to. The complaints do not appear to have affected  : American Horizons raised $750, 000 from July to September, a third of it from donors giving hundreds of dollars each. The committee has spent just $12, 000 on expenditures backing Mr. Trump. But the biggest chunk of spending, about $400, 000, went to fees to a consulting firm owned by the PAC\u2019s treasurer.", "label": "0"}, {"title": "Trump Catches What Sick Reporter Snuck In Interview, Has Priceless Response", "author": "Amanda Shea", "text": "Trump Catches What Sick Reporter Snuck In Interview, Has Priceless Response Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This CNN\u2019s Dana Bash (left), Bash Interviewing Donald Trump (right) \nDonald Trump stopped campaigning for just an hour-and-half to work in a brief appearance at the opening of his new hotel, where\u00c2 reporters awaited his arrival \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of which had a nasty surprise hidden up her sleeve.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m leaving here and going to North Carolina, then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to Florida, then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going up to New Hampshire. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. And yet you ask me that question. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very rude question .\u201d \nBash didn\u2019t see that coming, and Trump proved once again why America needs an unapologetic leader like him. He tells it how it is and backs up what he says with real action, unlike his competition who puts in a couple of days of campaigning and calls it good since it\u2019s all for show anyway. \nTrump is putting in ten times the effort with genuine work ethic on his own dime to honestly earn the votes, and if he wants to take a couple of minutes to make an appearance at an opening, he\u2019s more than entitled to do it. It pales in comparison to the weeks Hillary has had off relaxing and recovering.

And not just any functionary: they had contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. Worse (apparently) still, they initiated the contact with the Russians. The contact was a letter, signed by the entire Senate, urging Putin to release a valuable library of Jewish religious texts that was seized by earlier Russian regimes and which has been the subject of a legal and diplomatic dispute in recent decades.

[None of them were Muslim. All ten were from the Ukraine, and were either Baptist, Evangelical Christian, Uniate (a branch of Christian denomination found in eastern Europe) or Pentecostalist, according to the Department of State\u2019s interactive website.  Across the rest of the country, it was a different story. More than 75 percent of the 189 refugees who arrived in other parts of the United States on Tuesday, 151 in total, were Muslim, according to the Department of State\u2019s interactive website. It was the ultimate irony, since Judge Robart based his decision on an argument from Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson that Trump\u2019s executive order was unconstitutional because it was motivated by a desire to ban Muslims. \u201cPrior to his election, Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that he would ban Muslims from entering the United States,\u201d Ferguson alleged in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed by the state of Washington with the United States District Court Western District of Washington on January 30, 2017: On December 7, 2015, candidate Trump issued a press release calling for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. \u201d As of the date of this filing, the press release remains available on Trump\u2019s campaign website and is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. In defending his decision shortly thereafter, candidate Trump compared the Muslim ban to former President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s decision to intern Japanese Americans during World War II, and stated, \u201cThis is a president highly respected by all, [Roosevelt] did the same thing. \u201d A media report of this interview is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. On June 14, 2016, candidate Trump reiterated his promise to ban all Muslims entering this country until \u201cwe as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screenthose people coming into our country. \u201d \u201cSection 3 of the Executive Order, if implemented, will result in substantial burdens on the exercise of religion by   immigrants by, for example, preventing them from exercising their religion while in detention, returning to their religious communities in Washington,   taking upcoming, planned religious travel abroad. Such burdens on religion violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\u201d Ferguson argued in the January 30 complaint. In response to the Department of Justice\u2019s appeal of Judge Robart\u2019s decision to the 9th Federal Circuit Court, Ferguson restated that claim. \u201cHere, the State [of Washington] has plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity that the President acted in bad faith in an effort to target Muslims,\u201d Ferguson argued  in States\u2019 Response to Emergency Motion Under Circuit Rule   for Administrative Stay and Motion for Stay Pending Appeal filed with the 9th Federal Circuit Court on February 6, continuing with that theme. In the week between President Trump\u2019s signing of the executive order on January 27 and Judge Robart\u2019s issuance of the temporary restraining order halting it nationwide on February 3, the Trump administration granted waivers allowing 842 refugees to enter the country.

Predictably, just as it did against North Carolina, the NCAA and the Big 12 Conference look to act against Texas over the law. [After North Carolina passed its 2016 House Bill 2, which restricted some bathrooms, the NCAA decided to pull all tournament games from the state in protest over what the organization labeled \u201cdiscrimination. \u201d  At the time, the AP wrote that the state\u2019s governor criticized the NCAA for the move. \u201cGov. Pat McCrory says the NCAA failed to show North Carolina respect when it moved championships and tournament games out of the state because of a law that governs which bathrooms transgender people must use,\u201d the AP said. Now that Texas walks down the same legislative path that North Carolina blazed, the NCAA and Big 12 again look to punish a state. Announcing the effort in Texas, Lone Star State Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said of the new bill, \u201cThis issue is not about discrimination  \u2014   it\u2019s about public safety, protecting businesses and common sense,\u201d according to USA Today. Since the announcement in Texas, the NCAA has put the state on notice that they are watching. While the NCAA itself didn\u2019t have a statement at this time, the Big 12 did have something to say. \u201cThe Big 12 Conference is aware of the filing of Senate Bill 6 in the Texas State legislature,\u201d said Big 12 spokesman Bob Burda. \u201cWe will track the bill\u2019s progress through the legislature, and at an appropriate time discuss its impact with our member institutions. \u201d The NCAA acted quickly and with prejudice against North Carolina, but it\u2019s unclear whether it will act in a similar, swift manner against Texas. With at least five other states across the country contemplating similar bills, it may come to diminishing returns for the leagues to act in boycott. The boycott of one state came easy for them, but if five or more pass bathroom laws similar to North Carolina\u2019s the leagues may end up on the outside looking in. Along with Texas, other states now beginning the process of debating and enacting a bathroom bill include Alabama, Missouri, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington.

[Well, that did not happen, and ESPN appears to be a sinking ship, dragging parent company Disney down with it.  Bloomberg reports that ESPN badly hurt Disney\u2019s first quarter sales, falling well short of projections. According to The Wrap, \u201cCable networks, particularly ESPN, have been an albatross on Disney\u2019s stock price even as the company\u2019s two other major prongs, movies and theme parks, continue to perform well. As cheaper TV alternatives began to proliferate, ESPN hemorrhaged subscribers during the course of 2016 and is now at less than 88 million, compared with a peak of 100. 1 million in 2011. At an estimated $7 per subscriber, that dip has been a substantial hit to Disney, especially considering media networks made up 49 percent of Disney\u2019s profits during fiscal 2016. \u201d In other words, everyone else at Disney met or exceeded their projected goals, except for ESPN who lost more than twelve million subscribers in just under six years. But, the problem for ESPN goes deeper than just losing subscribers and money. The Wrap explains, \u201cAt the same time, rights fees for the live sports ESPN specializes in broadcasting continue to go up, as there\u2019s plenty of competition for one of the few pieces of programmed television that still delivers monster ratings. ESPN will pay $7. 3 billion for content this year  \u2014   the biggest price tag among all media companies. Operating income at Disney\u2019s cable networks division  \u2014   primarily ESPN  \u2014   plunged 11 percent compared with the same time the previous year. Disney attributed that drop entirely to lower ESPN revenue. \u201d Less cash on hand means less cash to purchase rights to sporting events, which can prove particularly harmful to an entity that considers itself a sports network. Now, Disney and ESPN have laid much of the blame for their subscriber loss at the feet of the cord cutting phenomenon that has impacted all cable providers to some degree. That\u2019s a fair point, but ESPN\u2019s losses have far exceeded the pace and rate of losses among other providers. ESPN will also cite the fact that they\u2019re rolling out more   streaming content that will offset much of the losses they\u2019ve taken on the cable side. Great, but what will ESPN show on those streaming channels? Will they show the   equivalent of Jason Bateman\u2019s ESPN \u201cThe Ocho?\u201d I enjoy a good game of dodgeball as much as the next guy, but unless ESPN plans on exclusively featuring the NFL, or   NBA games on their streaming networks, virtually no one will watch. Not to mention, it\u2019s highly unlikely that either the NBA or the NFL would enter into a contract with ESPN which allowed them to only offer their games via stream. So, what can ESPN do? In November, ESPN ombudsman Jim Brady wrote that he felt the network had become too liberal, turning off half the country and potentially effecting viewership and subscribership. Sadly, three months after that rare and blinding light of truth and honesty there\u2019s no reason to believe anything has changed regarding the politics of ESPN. Not when you have hosts like ESPN\u2019s Ryen Rusillo stating, on the air, that he no longer knows what his job is, since everyone around him just wants to bash Trump and talk liberal politics, instead of talking about sports. Maybe, if ESPN focused more on sports instead of alienating half the country, their business wouldn\u2019t be circling the drain right now. After all, Lady Gaga just did a halftime show in which she decided to not enrage half the country, and got rewarded with an enormous surge in digital music sales. Imagine that.

And what is there for the taking? What those famous hosts had accomplished: conducting the sort of interviews that could transfix a nation. \u201cThose were the biggest spots to go for an interview if you had something you wanted to get off your chest, if you were in the middle of a scandal or a major news story and you wanted to do a     to get past it or to go on the record,\u201d she said. She quickly added: \u201cAnd I\u2019m here!\u201d Making the Oprah or Barbara Walters leap is a remarkably tricky business. Many have tried before, with daytime shows or   specials, only to run into a wall and return to a more comfortable corner of television. And the interview special is a relic from a time on television when what was broadcast on the Big Four networks was what mattered most. But on Tuesday, Ms. Kelly, the Fox News anchor and host of \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d will take her first crack at a   special on Fox  \u2014   the broadcast network, not the cable news station  \u2014   with \u201cMegyn Kelly Presents. \u201d There is certainly one big hook to draw viewers: She will confront the likely Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, a man who over the last nine months has kept Ms. Kelly in the middle of a running news story by relentlessly attacking her. And though Mr. Trump represents the   get, she will also interview two actors (Michael Douglas and Laverne Cox) and a lawyer (Robert Shapiro) who is back in the news after the successful O. J. Simpson anthology \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d on FX. Mr. Trump aside, it is with those interviews that Ms. Kelly hopes to accomplish something new: prove that she can do much more than simply host a nightly news show. If all goes well, she will display range and versatility at a convenient time. Her contract with Fox News is set to expire in a little more than a year. \u201cI would like to prove to myself that I have these other muscles,\u201d she said, as she sat in her cramped office on Sixth Avenue. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t all have to be   level of difficulty. It can be other kinds of questioning where you get more to somebody\u2019s humanity and tell their story. \u201d She said that one of her benchmarks for success was if viewers said: \u201cI saw Megyn in a new light. \u201d Her Fox News show, \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d has been a hit for more than two years, but Ms. Kelly, who is 45, is in the middle of a big moment in her career. Since Mr. Trump began attacking her after the first Republican debate in August, Ms. Kelly has approached something close to genuine celebrity status. She was on the cover of Vanity Fair in February, she has made the rounds of the   circuit over the last three months. She also made her first appearance at the Met Gala in early May, the lavish Manhattan event that effectively serves as the year\u2019s social register for the rich and famous. There is also a book in the works  \u2014   she is handing in the manuscript to her editor at HarperCollins later this month and spent the last week writing the Trump section. It comes out the week after Election Day in November, and Tuesday will bring her the first   special. There are real questions whether the   \u201cspecial\u201d can attract a meaningful audience and lift a career. Long gone are the days when Ms. Walters could attract an audience of about 50 million people, as her exclusive interview with Monica Lewinsky did in 1999. But even in a fragmented TV landscape, they can occasionally break through. Last year, Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s revelation that she was transgender in an interview with Diane Sawyer drew nearly 17 million viewers, which qualifies as a huge hit these days. Ms. Kelly was reluctant to discuss a ratings goal. The producer for \u201cMegyn Kelly Presents,\u201d the veteran TV newsman Bill Geddie, pointed out that Fox did not ordinarily run these type of news specials and that expectations should be managed accordingly. \u201cMegyn said it right: We\u2019re looking for a single here,\u201d he said. The special can accomplish other goals for her instead. The news cycle has been relentlessly focused on politics and Ms. Kelly said she was more than happy to take a break from that. She is not a political junkie. \u201cThat\u2019s not all I am,\u201d she said \u201cI love covering the news, but I\u2019m not a political person, so I don\u2019t know that I get the jones out of immersing myself in politics all day, every day the way some others do. \u201d She added, \u201cYou look out at the news landscape, and there isn\u2019t the one perfect job that would service the soul. \u201d If that turn of phrase makes her sound a little like Oprah, it is probably not by accident. She pointed to Ms. Winfrey and Charlie Rose to illustrate her broader goals. \u201cOprah\u2019s a bit more spiritual and helps improve people\u2019s lives, which I also would like to do,\u201d she said. \u201cCharlie has a thing that I don\u2019t have. He will sit down with Brian Dennehy, who\u2019s got an amazing show on Broadway, and talk to him about it. He\u2019ll sit down with business executives like Tim Cook and talk to him about what\u2019s happening in his life. \u201d And if Ms. Kelly wants to be part Oprah, part Charlie Rose and also fill the Barbara Walters vacuum (\u201cWho in their right mind would reject that?\u201d she said of Ms. Walters) she got the right producer. Mr. Geddie produced more than 100 of Ms. Walters\u2019s   specials. \u201cMegyn Kelly Presents\u201d will be quite a departure from her regular   show: Say goodbye to the talking heads and   cuts, and cue a gauzier look, with two comfortable chairs and a contemplative head nod. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to step outside of it every once in a while and try out the Louis Vuitton luggage,\u201d she said. This is, of course, leads to the   question: What will happen when her contract expires next year? Whether or not the special is a success, she will have plenty of suitors lined up. And Fox News is keen to keep her. The special was the brainchild of the Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes, Ms. Kelly said. And she expressed loyalty to Mr. Ailes when asked about her future. \u201cThe number of times he\u2019s had my back, given me opportunities, stuck his own neck out there to protect me, I feel very grateful to him. \u201d She continued: \u201cHaving said that, this is a fickle business, and you never say never. Every time I\u2019ve been up for a contract negotiation I\u2019ve been   to what possibilities exist. \u201d Though the special may show how adept she is at interviewing a celebrity, much of the attention on Tuesday night will ultimately be on Mr. Trump, who made her his No. 1 media nemesis with his famous description of \u201cblood coming out of her   \u2026     wherever. \u201d Ms. Kelly said she planned to contact him for months but the attacks on her kept coming (Mr. Trump tweeted regularly about her, calling her \u201cCrazy Megyn,\u201d and he skipped the second Fox News debate in late January because of Ms. Kelly\u2019s involvement). She wanted him for this special, but it was not an easy assignment. Even Mr. Geddie, who has known Mr. Trump for 20 years, reached out and was given a flat no. It was not until April that Ms. Kelly reached out to Mr. Trump for the first time since the debate in August. She later met him alone at the Trump Tower to discuss the interview. Less than two weeks later, he was in. Though she concedes that Mr. Trump has made her \u201cname better known,\u201d she also refers to the last year as a dark one. There have been security concerns, and the stream of tweets from Mr. Trump and his supporters has been unpleasant. \u201cThis is one of the things that I get into with Trump in the interview,\u201d she said. \u201cNot about me but about whether he realizes the power his words have on the lives of his targets. Not just Megyn Kelly. \u201d In a campaign cycle in which the news media has been roundly criticized for kowtowing to Mr. Trump, Ms. Kelly has mostly been above it all. She even said on a March show: \u201cI\u2019m the    show in all of cable news and I haven\u2019t had Trump on in seven months. It can be done without him too. \u201d With the apparent rapprochement, is Ms. Kelly worried about the perception that she, too, is doing whatever needs to be done to get him for an interview? \u201cListen, if I weren\u2019t a journalist, would I have called up Trump and said \u2018Let\u2019s meet\u2019? No, I would not,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s because I\u2019m a journalist he was attacking me to begin with. So, no, you cannot compare me trying to put an end to his   barrage so that I can cover him like a normal journalist with the    obsessive coverage we have seen of his candidacy. \u201d Ms. Kelly expressed some frustration that she had been in the news for so long. Asked whether she thought Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks would end after the special was broadcast, she took a long pause, and said, without a great deal of confidence: \u201cI hope so.
